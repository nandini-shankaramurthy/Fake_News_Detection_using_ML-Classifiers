"Hyderabad: Sirisha Bandla, 34-year-old aeronautical engineer, is one among the 5 astronauts to fly into space with billionaire Richard Branson on board Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo Unity.
Bandla is also the third Indian-origin woman to head to space after Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams.
 
Born in Andhra Pradesh's Guntur and brought up in Houston, Texas, Bandla will join Branson and four others to make a journey to the space from New Mexico.
""I am so incredibly honored to be a part of the amazing crew of #Unity22, and to be a part of a company whose mission is to make space available to all,"" Bandla tweeted when the mission was announced.
""I really didn't need to tweet this since my friends flooded the feed yesterday with itRed heartI was overwhelmed (in a good way!) by messages of love, unrecognizable capital text, and positivity yesterday. Slowly working my way through them...one platform at a time!"" she added.

Bandla will be astronaut no 004 and her flight role will be Researcher Experience, according to her profile on Virgin Galactic.
""When I first heard that I was getting this opportunity, it was just. I think that that probably captured it very well, I was speechless. This is an incredible opportunity to get people from different backgrounds, different geographies and different communities into space,"" she said in a video posted on Virgin Galactic Twitter on July 6.
 
Speaking about the experience, Bandla said it was ""incredible"" and ""life-changing"" experience to see Earth from space.
""I am kind of still up there but it's so glad to be here. I was trying to think about a better word than incredible but that is the only word that can come to my mind... Seeing the view of Earth is so life-changing but also the boost the rocket motor kicking in. The whole trip to space and back is just amazing, Bandla told the NBC News in an interview.
Bandla described the moment as emotional and said, ""I have been dreaming of going to space since I was young and literally it is a dream come true.""
 
""I have wanted to be an astronaut but I wasn't able to go in the traditional National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) role and I took a very unconventional way to go to space and I do believe that a lot of people are going to be able to experience this and that's why we are here,"" she added.

On being asked if this was just a joyride for rich people, she said, ""As Virgin Galactic builds up...this is VSS Unity's ride to space today but we have got two more spaceships in the manufacture and we hope the cost would come down.""
Virgin Galactic  — the business Branson started in 2004  — aims to fly private citizens to the edge of space. The trips are designed to permit passengers to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and observe the curvature of Earth.
The Virgin Galactic carrier can launch up to eight people (two pilots and six passengers) on the Unity 22 flight, but on Sunday there were only six occupants (two pilots and four passengers).
 
The four mission specialists evaluated different experiences that Virgin Galactic has promised its future customers, many of whom have already reserved trips to space with the company at USD 250,000 a seat.

"Hyderabad: Veteran Bollywood actor Dilip Kumar who breathed his last on Wednesday at the age of 98 had his share of bittersweet memories of Hyderabad. He married a Hyderabadi woman Asma Rahman sometime in 1980, though he was already married to Saira Banu. Dilip Kumar said a conspiracy was hatched that forced him to marry Asma Rahman.
Saira Banu was reportedly not aware of Dilip Kumar’s marriage with Asma. She came to know about it in 1982 when a tabloid made this sensational revelation. Though Saira Banu was pained to hear the news, she stood by Dilip Kumar when he had admitted his mistake and sought her time to undo the wrong through proper legal process and restore the sanctity of their marriage. Later Dilip Kumar divorced Asma.
 
Dilip Kumar had inaugurated the Owaisi Hospital & Research Centre managed by All India Majlis Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen in 1996. At a young age, Dilip Kumar used to visit Hyderabad. He had attended a few functions and wedding ceremonies held in Hyderabad. Dilip Kumar also contributed to the development of the Deccan Medical College.

"Hyderabad: The city’s air is rife with Nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This is contrary to popular belief that the lockdown has helped improve the air quality, an analysis conducted by Greenpeace India Society has found.
Nitrogen dioxide pollution is known to cause damage to the human respiratory tract, cause asthma and make a person vulnerable to other respiratory infections. The study said there was growing evidence that polluted cities suffered disproportionately more from coronavirus cases.
 
Increased concentrations of NO2, Greenpeace said, were found not just in Hyderabad but across several cities in India during the current Covid19 pandemic.
The report published on Wednesday said: “In Hyderabad, nitrogen dioxide air pollution was 69 per cent higher in April 2021 than in the same month the previous year. A part of this difference is attributable to changing weather conditions. After removing the effect of weather, there is still an increase of 38 per cent which is attributed to an increase in emissions.”
After a year since the initial Covid lockdown went into effect, NO2 pollution has increased in eight Indian cities -- Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Lucknow.
 
According to satellite observations, NO2 pollution in Hyderabad increased by 69 per cent between April 2020 and April 2021. The weather had only a little of the contribution to this change. In Delhi, NO2 was higher by 125 per cent, Chennai by 94 per cent Mumbai by 52 per cent, Bengaluru by 90 per cent Kolkata by 11 per cent, Jaipur by 47 per cent and Lucknow by 32 per cent in April 2021 than in the same month the previous year
While there was an opinion that the weather conditions would abate the pollution, the result drawn out in the study showed that despite taking the weather conditions into account,  NO2 pollution occurred. This was primarily due to changes in emissions, while weather influence was only of secondary importance in most places,” it said.
 
According to Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner with Greenpeace India, “The air quality levels in these cities are alarming. People saw clean skies and breathed fresh air during the nationwide lockdown though it was an unintended consequence of the pandemic. The disruption caused by the pandemic is a case for transition to cleaner, equitable and sustainable decentralised energy sources such as rooftop solar and clean and sustainable mobility. The recovery from the pandemic must not come at the expense of a return to previous levels of air pollution.”

"Thiruvananthapuram: Tourists coming to Kerala will now be able to savour delicious local cuisine while sitting in the comfort of their cars as the state Tourism Department launched in-car dining to boost tourism and also to meet the challenges of COVID-19.
The restaurants run by Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) across the state will cater to tourists with in-car dining.
 
To know how it feels like dining in a car, Kerala Tourism Minister PA Mohammed Riyas himself had his favourite dishes sitting inside his car.
""The in-car dining is a project designed to give a boost to Kerala tourism sector hit badly by COVID-19. To revive we are launching this project by which tourists coming to Kerala will be able to use this service. Amid COVID-19 pandemic, instead of dining inside a restaurant and mingling with the crowd, such a project will also ensure safety,"" said Riyas.
Kayamkulam MLA U Pratibha also joined the minister during the launch of the project.
 
This venture comes at a time when tourism, which is a mainstay of Kerala that contributes to 11 per cent to state SDP, incurred loss due to COVID-19.
To overcome the crisis, the Kerala government also has mooted the idea of complete vaccinated tourism and also to find new tourism destinations.
The Tourism Minister said the state has initiated a project in which a new destination will be identified in every Panchayat. There are also projects in the pipeline to develop new heritage and pilgrim tourism destinations to attract maximum domestic travellers.

"New Delhi: “Matrimonial ad by a feminist” is an oxymoron. These advertisements are often sexist and casteist, putting emphasis on attributes like caste, class, height, and the colour of one’s skin, and using salary and other wealth related attributes to appeal to potential matrimonial partners.
However, a matrimonial advertisement “by a feminist” went viral after comedian Aditi Mittal tweeted about it, bringing the advertisement into the limelight.
 
The advertisement read: “Match for opinionated feminist. 30+ educated girl, short hair, piercings, works in the social sector against capitalism. Wanted handsome, well-built, strictly 25-28 years old only son with established business, bungalow/at least 20 acre farmhouse. Should know cooking. No farters/burpers please. Write to curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com.”
The advertisement, obviously fake, was a prank to emphasise the sexist and misogynistic ideology behind matrimonial advertisements. The owners of the email curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com- under the pseudonyms Sakshi, her brother Srijan and her best friend Damyanti- told BBC that it was a prank played on Sakshi for her 30th birthday.
 
""Turning 30 is a milestone, especially because of all the conversation in our society around marriage. As you turn 30, your family and society start putting pressure on you to get married and settle down,"" Srijan said.
However, once the advertisement went viral, it reopened the debate of the sexism and misogyny of matrimonial ads. Though she did receive many positive emails, Sakshi claimed that there were a plethora of hate emails sent her way as the ad hurt a lot of fragile egos, ranging from feminism-bashers to trolls sending death threats over a prank.
 
""You can't say such things out loud. Men ask for tall, slim beautiful brides all the time, they brag about their wealth, but when the tables are turned, they can't stomach it. How could a woman set such criteria?"" She added, ""[The ad] was a satirical statement on this narrative and I assume that the people getting triggered are the same as those who put out these kinds of 'slim, fair, beautiful bride wanted' type of ads in the first place"".
And for those upset by an obvious prank, she asks: ""Do you send such triggered emails to all the sexist, casteist 'bride wanted' adverts that appear in the papers everyday? If not, then you need to curb your patriarchy"".

"Hyderabad: It was a chance discovery, says Dr Kumar Eswaran, a mathematical physicist in the city, who claims to have found the solution to the Riemann Hypothesis, a millennium problem in mathematics. It was waiting for proof for 161 years, Dr Eswaran told this newspaper.
The Riemann Hypothesis, touted to be number one out of the top 10 unsolved mathematical problems, was designated as a millennium problem in 2000, with a reward of $1 million from Clay Mathematics Institute, Oxford, England, for anyone who could solve it.
 
""It was, in fact, back in 2016, that I first gave proof for the formula improved by the great mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann in the 1800s. I had put it on the web for open review and downloads after working on it for about six weeks. During 2018-19, I gave several lectures on the proof,” Dr Eswaran, 74, who is with the Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Hyderabad, said.
The Riemann Hypothesis, in the simplest possible explanation, relates to how prime numbers are distributed. This has been a problem that has challenged mathematicians for generations. According to mathematicians who have grappled with the hypothesis, proof of the Riemann Hypothesis would have far-reaching consequences for number theory and for the use of primes in cryptography, and would automatically lead to the proof of numerous theorems which are dependent on the truth of this hypothesis.
 
In Dr Eswaran's methodology, the ‘factorisation sequence of numbers’ was shown to be like a 'random walk', he said. ""This method used was actually not just number theories. I had to use techniques from random variables and probability as well,"" Dr Eswaran added.  
An expert committee of scientists including Dr T. Ramasami, former secretary, Union ministry of science and technology, Prof. P. Narasimha Reddy, executive director, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Prof. M. Seetharaman, former professor and Chair, department of theoretical physics, University of Madras, Prof. V. Srinivasan, former professor and dean, School of Physics, UoH, Prof. K. Srinivasa Rao, former senior professor, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, Prof. M. D. Srinivas, senior Fellow, Centre for Policy Studies, Prof. Vinayak Eswaran, department of mechanical and aerospace engineering, IIT Hyderabad, and Dr Adindla Suma, associate professor, department of computer science, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology conducted an open review of the proof for a year from February 2020 to conclude that Dr Eswaran had indeed proved the Riemann Hypothesis.  
 
The committee invited more than 1,200 mathematicians to participate in an open review of the presented proof. The review was open in the sense that the referees had to be willing to have their names and institutional affiliations openly revealed, so that nothing is done anonymously, and nothing can be said that would not be openly available for all other experts to see.
Dr Eswaran said in his experience this had been the most fair and robust way to get the proposed proof assessed. The expert committee then examined the comments of the reviewers and the responses of the author. In their final meeting held on May 16, the committee concluded that Dr Eswaran’s proof of the Riemann Hypothesis is correct.
 
The committee also ruled that the proof, the referees’ comments, and the author’s responses in their entirety, without any redactions, should be published in the form of an e-book and made available to the public at large and then followed, a few months later, by a hard copy.

"ANANTAPUR: Lack of rains yet in parts of Rayalaseema has led to rural people enacting the centuries-old tradition of protesting against the Rain God with “Karuvu Rallu” or drought stones.
As per the tradition, villagers in this drought-prone region throw waste material of their village, including the drought stones, on outskirts of another village to appease the Rain God into showering rains. Villagers, however, exercise caution while throwing the drought stones, lest it lead to a clash with members of the targeted village.
 
All such stones are finally dumped into Penna and other rivers of Rayalaseema bordering Karnataka. Senior citizens say this tradition has been continuing even to this day, as the practise not only appeases the Rain God but also checks farmers from falling into depression due to their inability in raising crops.
This Deccan Chronicle reporter saw a dump of drought stones on outskirts of Seebai village in Kalyanadurgam mandal of Anantapur district. They must have been dumped there by inmates of one of the villages trying to appease the Rain God.
 
Rajanna from Kalayandurgam area said this tradition has been a part of Rayalaseema farmers’ life for many centuries. Karuvu Rallu on outskirts of another village are seen as a positive sign.
Dr. Harinath Reddy of Rayalaseema Vedika says this tradition of protest is mostly seen in villages around Goddess Gangamma temples, which are constructed mostly close to river beds and irrigation tanks. “At these temples, villagers seeking rains offer traditional poojas and ululate to express their grief at lack of rains”, Dr Reddy explained.
 
According to reports available, many areas of Rayalaseema have experienced 72 drought years in the past 145 years. Such high variability in southwest monsoon is an indicator of the risk associated with farming in this district. It has 7 lakh hectares of dry land whose cultivators depend only on seasonal rains.

"Hyderabad: Milkha Singh made waves at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, but his baby steps as a sprinter were taken here in Secunderabad, where he was recruited in the Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (EME) of the Army back in 1952.
The ’Flying Sikh’ died of Covid complications late on Saturday night. He was 91.
 
He trained in and around the EME Centre area, building his strength and stamina by taking up many an uphill task — he would run up the Ammuguda hill carrying a stone-filled bag and also run alongside a train, which ran on the then metre gauge track between Bolaram and Ammuguda. “The driver of a particular train used to encourage and egg me on. It was kind of a motivation and I could run for a longer distance,” Milkha recalled in interviews later.
He has always credited the Army, EME and Secunderabad Cantonment for his sporting success. “Had I not joined the Army I would not have worked so hard,” Milkha said.
 
Fittingly, a colony in the EME Centre is named after him, as also the Stadium inside the EME Centre where he trained. While inaugurating the Milkha Singh Stadium in 2014, the legend had got emotional, kissed the turf and said it was like a gurudwara to him.
Secunderabad, where Milkha lived from 1952 to 1960 and prepared for the 1960 Olympics at which he missed the 400 metres bronze medal by a whisker, was always special to him. “Whenever he came across athletes from Secunderabad/ Hyderabad, he would develop an instant affinity. ‘Mai Secunderabad ka rice khaney ke baad running start kiya’ (I have started running after eating rice in Secunderabad) he once told me in jest. He would also talk about his many memories here,” Prabhakara Rao Mulagala, veteran long-distance runner from the city, told this newspaper.
 
“We should also remember Milkha used to run on cinder tracks, not on the present synthetic ones that give athletes the advantage of up to a second. He was the first to run the 400m under 46 seconds, at a meet in Oslo (Norway) a fortnight or so before the Rome Olympics, where he was unfortunate to finish fourth, 0.1 second behind Malcolm Spence of South Africa. Later, South Africa was banned from sport for 36 years because of apartheid... that bronze could’ve belonged to Milkha, who competed against the world’s best,” added Prabhakara, who has won 300-plus gold medals at national and international races, and at 69 still competes in races.

Dr. Harinath Reddy of Rayalaseema Vedika says this tradition of protest is mostly seen in villages around Goddess Gangamma temples, which are constructed mostly close to river beds and irrigation tanks. “At these temples, villagers seeking rains offer traditional poojas and ululate to express their grief at lack of rains”, Dr Reddy explained.
 
According to reports available, many areas of Rayalaseema have experienced 72 drought years in the past 145 years. Such high variability in southwest monsoon is an indicator of the risk associated with farming in this district. It has 7 lakh hectares of dry land whose cultivators depend only on seasonal rains.

"Hyderabad: If a scriptwriter had proposed a few years ago a logline for a movie which read – an actor from Punjabi, with a six-pack body, who has played a villain on screen for over two decades, finds a calling in the midst of a pandemic.
His real-life works make him the most beloved superstar across the country, the trust in him built rapidly as he works to connect, first with migrant workers and trying to help them, and as a second wave hits, responding to people from across the country, reaching out to him with a trust they repose in him greater than in governments. And in cineaste Telugu states, gods of decades slide down the charts, downed by a virus, leaving only one real star.
 
Such a script would never have found a director accepting it. Even the audiences would have found it beyond plausibility, even for a story. But when life scripts stories and reality screens it, not for two hours but years, anything is possible. Such has been the script starring Sonu Sood since Coronavirus spread its menacing tentacles and brought down every order of society and all semblances of sanity.
But in dark times, heroes arise from unexpected spots. Lending help, giving hope, sharing light, redefining love, and metamorphosing fan following.
 
Speaking to Deccan Chronicle about his inner motivations to emerge from the fringes of celebritydom to becoming a trusted icon of a ravage nation’s people, Sonu Sood, in a soft soothing voice of a healer rather than a preferred negative actor of the movie screen, said, “growing up in Moga, Punjab, I saw my mother, a teacher, give free tuition classes for decades. Outside my father’s shop, there would always be a langar, where I too would serve food. It was a lesson ingrained for life that you must always be there to serve in whatever capacity you have.”
 
When asked about the incident that prompted him to emerge out of lockdown and pandemic fears to become a frontline hero, Mr Sood said, “last year, when I started hearing stories of migrant workers, I knew I could no longer sit in the security and comfort of my home. As a migrant worker myself, though privileged and lucky, I could empathise with their angst. It started with serving food and giving basic financial help to organising to help them in larger numbers.”
The legend grew quickly because of the vacuum. None of India’s conventional heroes – film stars, cricketers, billionaires – were there to really make a significant difference. Sood’s rise in being recognised as a saviour is also a deep reflection of the indifference of the others.
 
How do you feel about being recognised and trusted so much by people that they tag you on twitter for help before government agencies or ministers? Do you feel pressure to deliver?
He smiles, and in one of the most humane voices I have heard in a long time, replies, “there is no pressure when a friend or family member expects you to stand for them. It is no different. Every bit of time, money and effort I can muster, I am out there because I know somewhere, someone who has reached out to me is waiting and expecting. It is a call I must respond to, and I can’t let them down.”
 
I scratch my head, a bit bewildered. Is it a mere PR exercise? Or did I get connected to Dalia Lama by mistake? It is, I do not think it is his fault that others in the cine world have used charity as a ticket to sell more tickets for their next release. Last year, we were stuck with the tragic story of another SS in Bollywood – Sushant Singh. This SS has risen now to become India’s superhero, without a cape, just a twitter handle.
Are you a bit embarrassed Sonu, I ask him, that others in your film fraternity, Bollywood or Tollywood, who have received greater stardom and earned far more money and influence, never cared to take up work like yours in one of our worst years ever? He answers candidly, but with sangfroid. “You can’t force a feeling of wanting to help people. It can’t even be taught beyond a point. It must come from within.”
 
What next? Will this image harm your film career? Next time any film fans see him on screen as a villain, will the portrayal be convincing? “I am not thinking of the next film. Just my next SOS call.”
He disappears to do good for someone, somewhere. A villain has refined heroism, forever. My vote for the biggest star in films in India in a dark year – Sonu Sood.

"Hyderabad: Milkha Singh made waves at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, but his baby steps as a sprinter were taken here in Secunderabad, where he was recruited in the Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (EME) of the Army back in 1952.
The ’Flying Sikh’ died of Covid complications late on Saturday night. He was 91.
 
He trained in and around the EME Centre area, building his strength and stamina by taking up many an uphill task — he would run up the Ammuguda hill carrying a stone-filled bag and also run alongside a train, which ran on the then metre gauge track between Bolaram and Ammuguda. “The driver of a particular train used to encourage and egg me on. It was kind of a motivation and I could run for a longer distance,” Milkha recalled in interviews later.
He has always credited the Army, EME and Secunderabad Cantonment for his sporting success. “Had I not joined the Army I would not have worked so hard,” Milkha said.
 
Fittingly, a colony in the EME Centre is named after him, as also the Stadium inside the EME Centre where he trained. While inaugurating the Milkha Singh Stadium in 2014, the legend had got emotional, kissed the turf and said it was like a gurudwara to him.
Secunderabad, where Milkha lived from 1952 to 1960 and prepared for the 1960 Olympics at which he missed the 400 metres bronze medal by a whisker, was always special to him. “Whenever he came across athletes from Secunderabad/ Hyderabad, he would develop an instant affinity. ‘Mai Secunderabad ka rice khaney ke baad running start kiya’ (I have started running after eating rice in Secunderabad) he once told me in jest. He would also talk about his many memories here,” Prabhakara Rao Mulagala, veteran long-distance runner from the city, told this newspaper.
 
“We should also remember Milkha used to run on cinder tracks, not on the present synthetic ones that give athletes the advantage of up to a second. He was the first to run the 400m under 46 seconds, at a meet in Oslo (Norway) a fortnight or so before the Rome Olympics, where he was unfortunate to finish fourth, 0.1 second behind Malcolm Spence of South Africa. Later, South Africa was banned from sport for 36 years because of apartheid... that bronze could’ve belonged to Milkha, who competed against the world’s best,” added Prabhakara, who has won 300-plus gold medals at national and international races, and at 69 still competes in races.

"Nellore: The Ayush department team studying the concoction prepared by Bonigi Anandaiah at Krishnapatnam and hawked as a cure for Covid-19 cannot be termed an Ayurvedic medicine.
They said that Ayush protocols and guidelines do not accept these preparations as Ayurvedic drugs. They felt that the preparations were similar to traditional local medicines, hinting that there is no need for any licence.
 
Speaking to this newspaper, Commissioner of Ayush and head of the team, Col. V. Ramulu, said that there are no harmful ingredients in the substance being given by Anandaiah, including the eye drops.
“Anandaiah prepared all them before us and the process is very simple for anyone to produce. Moreover, he is willing to share the formula with the public,” he said.
The Ayush official said that Anandaiah has been using herbs including locally available leaves such as neem, mango and jamun apart from honey, pepper, green camphor, nutmeg, black cumin, turmeric and cinnamon among many other items, “which we use daily for preparing food items.”
 
In the eye drops, Anandaiah has been using pepper, mulla vankaya and honey, Col Ramulu noted. He said that the preparation cannot be prescribed for Covid-19 as the formula is one among hundreds of local remedies for different ailments. Citing an instance, he pointed to the popular Puttur treatment for broken bones.
Col Ramulu said they would submit a report to the government on their study. It is up to the government to take a decision, he added.

"Hyderabad: On turning 43 in May two year ago, Pushpak, a highly successful senior executive with a global fin-tech firm located in the Financial District, made several changes in his lifestyle. These included getting a farm house in the town, buying a new SUV and promising to block his calendar for a family holiday abroad.
His fitness goals included joining a gym, cycling and running. His life revolved around the stress of managing his own wealth portfolio as also his financial goals and ambitions.
 
Two years later, the SUV means far less to him. His farmhouse seems a trifle less important.
He has lost two members in his extended family, a close friend and several friends. He has failed at least in one case; despite all the money, he failed to get an ICU bed for a close relative in another city.
He now has a new priority; having peace of mind. After many trials, he has chosen an unlikely route – meditation – to achieve his goal.
Speaking on the eve of World Meditation Day, Pushpak says, “I knew it but missed the significance of such an elementary truth in life. Life is all about breathing. We breathe, we are alive. For all my life, I took it for granted. Today, anxiety and stress, fear and worry are all taking a toll on my life. Corona has raised questions on what we thought was our success. The calm of being aware of my own breath has been the greatest learning.”
 
He’s alone now. Hordes of people have been forced by the pandemic and its continuing challenges to seek and find mental peace through meditation.
Kamala Chirravuri, one of the top-notch yoga meditation teachers in Hyderabad, has celebrities -- those with serious mental issues and corporate executives -- seeking her help. She offers them counseling and personalized yoga-meditation solutions.
“Meditation as defined by Patanjali comprises dharana and dhyana. Dharana is singularly focusing all our conscious attention on one object, the starting point of meditation. Dhyana is the highest level we can achieve, wherein we are immersed and become one with the flow,” she says.
 
When asked about her heightened interest in meditation, Kamala replies, “It feels like we are in the midst of a mythological pralaya. To face the unrest outside, we must find strength, peace and calm within. Once we learn to focus our attention within, and become aware of our breath, we find a center and we reduce the imbalance that causes stress, anxiety and unrest.”
A trainer in the Krishnamacharya tradition, Kamala is comfortable with the diversity of meditation techniques. “There are many techniques from Vipassana, the focus on breath and sensations, to chanting of ‘Om’ to visualizations. Anything that works for you! But the one constant in life is our breathing.”
 
Sanjay Sehgal, a director at Heartfulness, says, “In our technique, we begin with thought as a focal point and dive deeper into the heart. This is a 76-years-old technique of diving deeper and achieving a higher level of consciousness.”
He says, “People may reach out for various reasons. Relieving your stress or finding peace is easy. I often say, you can find peace with a peg of good whiskey or if you can avoid fighting with your spouse. But finding sustainable inner peace, to be a better person, is harder, which is where we take you to.”
 
The heart-centred meditation, which has millions of practitioners, over 14,000 trainers and over 260 ashrams in 130 nations, renders its service all free.
When quizzed about the recent spurt in interest, Sehgal says, “Even a basic practice of pranayamam will help you at a physical level. It expands your lungs and eases the flow of air from your nose to inside. It can most certainly help during Covid times. Bad things can happen to anyone. But a great gift of meditation is that it helps you alter and find a better sense of control over your own reactions and responses. I have seen in my own family that those who meditate had a distinctly different and qualitatively better response to the emergencies arising out of the Covid pandemic than to those who don’t meditate.”
 
Trainers have adopted technology in the Covid season to ensure that meditation can be taught in the virtual mode. From an institutional meditation like Heartfulness, whose global headquarters is in Hyderabad and whose spiritual leader Daaji has held remote virtual sessions to individual trainers like Kamala, to those who are doing sessions through Zoom or Google Meets, technology is helping bring together the agitated with those who guide you to inner peace.

"HYDERABAD: The air inside is cool, but thick with Coronavirus. Among the 13 patients in a Covid-19 ICU, some are on ventilators as their bodies wracked by the virus try and fight back the disease.
The sight is pathetic. The tube inside the throat adds to their cough. Each time a patient coughs, countless virus particles are spewed into the air.
 
Inside the blue full body protection kits, doctors, nurses and other support staff go about their tasks methodically. At stake are the lives of infected patients who, along with their families, have placed their faith in god the almighty and the hospital staff.
The staff in attendance is practising a new regimen of long shifts on slim meals and controlled fluid intake. “If anyone wants to take a break, they will take off the PPE kits and spend 20 minutes in the restroom and spend another 20 minutes putting on a fresh kit. In the meanwhile, we need to find a replacement for that person for a similar duration,” explained Dr K. Subba Reddy, chief intensivist at Apollo Hospital.
 
Last year, when patients began streaming into the ICU at Apollo in Jubilee Hills, there was fear and apprehension among the staff. Everyone was worried and scared. It was Annapurna, a senior housekeeping staffer, who gave the medics the confidence to carry on.
“I had attended to the requirements of TB, AIDS and Chicken Pox patients. We overcame those situations with courage and we can overcome this too,” she had told them. “That gave us a lot of motivation and strength. Then there was one of our nurses Pyun Su Klin, who lost her sister and brother in the first wave. Yet, she said she will not take a break or go home, but continued to work, saying there were so many pat-ients around to be taken care of,” Dr Subba Reddy recalled. While the stress of working to save lives every minute is itself a challenging experience, so is it that an ICU staffer cannot mingle with own family as a matter of precaution.
 
The air in a Covid-19 ICU is thick with the virus. Intubated patients are coughing, generating aerosols carrying the virus particles.
Subba Reddy, over the past one year, has only been seeing his 11-year-old daughter from a distance, in a different apartment where she lives with her grandparents. Going nearer meant a risk to the child.
Coming off a prolonged 72-hour shift, Dr K. Swarna Deepak, also of Apollo, told Deccan Chronicle on Sunday: “Sometimes you just cannot take a break. Over the last couple of days, we opened more ICUs for Covid patients.”
 
And if a hospital runs out of ventilators, the doctors and nurses would resort to sheer physical stamina, drawing every ounce of strength they have to keep a patient alive.
Using a bag ventilator, they keep pumping, squeezing the bag to push oxygen into a patient’s lungs. “And when one arm gets tired, you just switch arms and continue. As long as it takes,” Dr Deepak said.
Elsewhere, at KIMS hospital, Dr Sambit Sahu, a critical and intensive care specialist, talks wistfully of what the scene was just a few weeks ago. “We barely had three patients in the Covid19 ICU. Then it hit us like a storm. All of a sudden, it was 50 patients; and by the time we realised what was happening, we had a 100 of them in these ICUs,” he said.
 
Unlike last year, Covid19 was a novel disease and what everyone heard about it came from other parts of the world. The second wave is different. There was a sense of mental fatigue, of coming out of a stressful year. “We just got out of a traumatic year. And the feeling as the patients began pouring in was Oh God! Not Again!,” Dr Sahu said.
As the virus keeps flying around in the ICUs, the doctors have just one prayer on their lips; that they be able to save the life of every patient and that people at large followed the safety measures and helped medical professionals by keeping the case loads low.
 
“If that does not happen soon, we are in for a disaster,” said Dr Subba Reddy.

"HYDERABAD: Doctors and nurses attending to Covid-19 patients and posting their videos on social media sum up the trauma they experience in Covid wards, where the pandemic is staging a dance of death and devastation. End of the day, they often break down into tears.
Medical professionals handling the dying patients say counseling their families on the wait outside is itself a huge task and painful experience. Cases are one too many, hospitals are running out of beds, there is shortage of support systems and life-saving equipment, and the virus’s variants are often difficult to identify.
 
The medical staff is face-to-face with death and strained also by the extra hours of work day after day, in iterations. Worse, they are exposed closer to this deadly virus than the general public.
Many doctors, nurses and other medical staff have lost their lives while treating the patients. Here is a war-like situation. They are also scared about the possibility that they carry the killer virus home and spread it to the family.
Alongside comes the people’s irresponsible behavior, couldn’t-care-less attitude, the mass gatherings, political rallies, cinema craze, all helping spread the deadly virus. All these are happening when the frontline Covid warriors are staking their lives and attending to patients non-stop and gasping for breath.
 
Dr Anita Rego, mental health professional and psychotherapist, said: “As frontline workers they deal with the real miseries of the patients, those who are struggling on their beds, those who are breathing their last. The stories of medical success are often clouded by these realities. We need to build an envelope of caring professionals and psychotherapists on whom they can fall back and build their strength and energy.”
She added: “Providing healthcare workers with stronger networks of specialist mental health services is not yet a priority with our health system and we need to advocate it.”
 
Dr Daljeet Kaur, consultant psychiatrist, said: “There will be frustration, stress and anxiety. The medical staff is disheartened because the situation is not in their control. When it comes to the doctors’ level, the coronavirus variants are unpredictable and it is difficult for them to understand the prognosis of patients.”
“The stress level, though, varies between individual and individual. While a senior doctor might be stressed and overwhelmed, a nursing staff or paramedic on the frontline and spending more time with the patient is more depressed seeing the conditions from close quarters.”
 
She suggested: “Counselors should be allocated for patients and the attenders. This will reduce the load of the consulting doctors. The medical staff should also be counseled on a periodical basis. Mental health of the medical staff should be a priority.”
 
QUOTES
Dr J Shivkumar, senior cardiologist: “The medical professionals are always under stress due to various reasons. Now, in the Covid situation, they are putting their lives on stake and saving the patient, whereas the general public is game with flaunting all the Covid protocols, further straining the health sector facilities.”
 
Dr Ashish Chauhan, Covid care expert at Apollo Hospital: “With an exposure some 100 to 1,000 times more that of the general public, the health care professionals are dead scared while performing their duties. Currently they are working like a soldier, ready to be martyred during a war. A sincere thanks by the patients and their relatives is what they expect.” 
“As per an IMA study, an average Indian doctor lives 10 years lesser than the normal population. Now, some 70 to 80 per cent of the patients are treated and they walkout healthy whereas some 20 to 30 per cent die. This is not an easy sight to digest.”
 
Dr  Karuna Madap, paediatrician, Covid-care: “Health care warriors should protect themselves and their families first. If they are physically and mentally strong, they can take care of hundreds patients. The medical staff should constantly take proper counseling for their mental health from a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist. There should be some organisation to come forward and provide nutritious food for the medical staff.”
Dr Sahithi Reddy Lebaka, junior doctor at Fever Hospital, Nallakunta: “Wearing plastic PPE kits for hours in his summer is not an easy task. Restless extra shifts due to constant patient flow, insufficient medical supplies and instruments, all these mean for us a mental fatigue.”
 
Dr M A Faroqui, professor, PG department of Unani medicine, Tibbi College, Charminar: “On Wednesday, two doctors in this Unani hospital have perished due to Covid-19. Over time, we will be drained out. There has to be equal participation of the public to overcome the present grim situation. When that fails to happen, we become mentally upset.”
Laxman Rudavath, Telangana nursing officers association general secretary: “Nurses are the first to serve patients. Even in these deadly situations, we take care of patients to the best.

Jyothi, staff nurse, King Koti Hospital (Covid Centre): “We are exposed to so much of trauma during this pandemic. There is a sudden spike in the cases. When we return home we are out of our mood. Yes, there should be some mental health counselors for the medical workers.”
Sarala Kancharla, staff nursem Gandhi Hospital (State-assigned Covid-19 hospital): “The pouring in of patients, all around us, it’s suffering and suffering…  the shortage of staff, lack of support, our exposure to this deadly virus, the constant fear of us getting infected, we are stressed a lot these days.”
 
Ravindar Reddy, sanitization supervisor: “This wave made many of us think: is this worth taking risk? We are also seeing discrimination near our place, we are very depressed these days, and yet work should go on.”
Haseena Begum, Ayah, Nelofer Hospital: “Seeing the sufferings of patients, especially little children who are infected by coronavirus, makes us more sad and these days we don’t even feel like eating. We all are so scared!”

"HYDERABAD: The air inside is cool, but thick with Coronavirus. Among the 13 patients in a Covid-19 ICU, some are on ventilators as their bodies wracked by the virus try and fight back the disease.
The sight is pathetic. The tube inside the throat adds to their cough. Each time a patient coughs, countless virus particles are spewed into the air.
 
Inside the blue full body protection kits, doctors, nurses and other support staff go about their tasks methodically. At stake are the lives of infected patients who, along with their families, have placed their faith in god the almighty and the hospital staff.
The staff in attendance is practising a new regimen of long shifts on slim meals and controlled fluid intake. “If anyone wants to take a break, they will take off the PPE kits and spend 20 minutes in the restroom and spend another 20 minutes putting on a fresh kit. In the meanwhile, we need to find a replacement for that person for a similar duration,” explained Dr K. Subba Reddy, chief intensivist at Apollo Hospital.
 
Last year, when patients began streaming into the ICU at Apollo in Jubilee Hills, there was fear and apprehension among the staff. Everyone was worried and scared. It was Annapurna, a senior housekeeping staffer, who gave the medics the confidence to carry on.
“I had attended to the requirements of TB, AIDS and Chicken Pox patients. We overcame those situations with courage and we can overcome this too,” she had told them. “That gave us a lot of motivation and strength. Then there was one of our nurses Pyun Su Klin, who lost her sister and brother in the first wave. Yet, she said she will not take a break or go home, but continued to work, saying there were so many pat-ients around to be taken care of,” Dr Subba Reddy recalled. While the stress of working to save lives every minute is itself a challenging experience, so is it that an ICU staffer cannot mingle with own family as a matter of precaution.
 
The air in a Covid-19 ICU is thick with the virus. Intubated patients are coughing, generating aerosols carrying the virus particles.
Subba Reddy, over the past one year, has only been seeing his 11-year-old daughter from a distance, in a different apartment where she lives with her grandparents. Going nearer meant a risk to the child.
Coming off a prolonged 72-hour shift, Dr K. Swarna Deepak, also of Apollo, told Deccan Chronicle on Sunday: “Sometimes you just cannot take a break. Over the last couple of days, we opened more ICUs for Covid patients.”
 
And if a hospital runs out of ventilators, the doctors and nurses would resort to sheer physical stamina, drawing every ounce of strength they have to keep a patient alive.
Using a bag ventilator, they keep pumping, squeezing the bag to push oxygen into a patient’s lungs. “And when one arm gets tired, you just switch arms and continue. As long as it takes,” Dr Deepak said.
Elsewhere, at KIMS hospital, Dr Sambit Sahu, a critical and intensive care specialist, talks wistfully of what the scene was just a few weeks ago. “We barely had three patients in the Covid19 ICU. Then it hit us like a storm. All of a sudden, it was 50 patients; and by the time we realised what was happening, we had a 100 of them in these ICUs,” he said.
 
Unlike last year, Covid19 was a novel disease and what everyone heard about it came from other parts of the world. The second wave is different. There was a sense of mental fatigue, of coming out of a stressful year. “We just got out of a traumatic year. And the feeling as the patients began pouring in was Oh God! Not Again!,” Dr Sahu said.
As the virus keeps flying around in the ICUs, the doctors have just one prayer on their lips; that they be able to save the life of every patient and that people at large followed the safety measures and helped medical professionals by keeping the case loads low.
 
“If that does not happen soon, we are in for a disaster,” said Dr Subba Reddy.

"New Delhi: Romanian writer-director Radu Jude’s Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn opens with a naughty, kinky pornographic scene. Emi (Katia Pascariu), a school teacher, is having sex with her husband and they are recording the proceedings for a bit of extra thrill.
But somehow the sex tape leaks and is soon making the rounds of giggly WhatsApp groups of her students and their parents. Some download it, purportedly as evidence to beat Emi with. The fact that the sex is consensual, between a husband and wife is irrelevant. There is outrage, and it's mostly about how could a middle-aged, married woman be so raunchy.
 
Radu Jude’s film, which uses this porn clip and the subsequent ""trial"" of Emi in the school’s yard to draw circles around a society's hypocrisy, won the Golden Bear award for Best Film at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Friday.
The film is split in three parts. In the first, Loony Porn walks with Emi as she visits her school principal, goes to a book store and a pharmacy. Shot during the Coronavirus pandemic, this segment has visuals of a city all masked up and wary of social interactions. But it's also a city busy consuming, enraging, eradicating the past.
 
We watch arguments and fights in a supermarket, with owners of big cars who block the sidewalk as a matter of their right. Each clash is an assertion of the entitlement of the rich and marginalisation of others.
The film’s second part is polyphonic and here, through commentary, archival footage, statistics, words, nudes in newspapers, building rising and in ruins, Loony Porn tells the story of Romania — about its role in the Holocaust, its attitude to Jews, Romas, love for dictators, attitude to sex and children. It also tells us that in Romania, 6 out of 10 kids are subjected to family violence.
 
This fact hovers over the film's last segment -- the meeting called by the school principal and parents to interrogate and then vote on Emi’s future. It is kicked off by a parent who insists on playing the sex clip for the benefit of all those gathered.
This scene, framed like an inquisition — the ""accused"" is in the middle, flanked by a judge who will rule based on the mood of the people and the enforcer of morality — is both dark and funny. Though allegations, tangential discussions, innuendoes, inappropriate remarks, shrill sanctimony and, finally, the judgment, Loony Porn lays bare a nation that has revised its history to legitimise its past and current criminal acts and feels emboldened to air its prejudice, bigotry and misplaced rage. Because many speak in the same tongue, collective hypocrisy gets elevated to a sanctimonious, narcissistic chorus.  
 
What's striking is how familiar it all feels. This searing portrait of a nation and its people could well be a day in the life of India.

"HYDERABAD: Doctors and nurses attending to Covid-19 patients and posting their videos on social media sum up the trauma they experience in Covid wards, where the pandemic is staging a dance of death and devastation. End of the day, they often break down into tears.
Medical professionals handling the dying patients say counseling their families on the wait outside is itself a huge task and painful experience. Cases are one too many, hospitals are running out of beds, there is shortage of support systems and life-saving equipment, and the virus’s variants are often difficult to identify.
 
The medical staff is face-to-face with death and strained also by the extra hours of work day after day, in iterations. Worse, they are exposed closer to this deadly virus than the general public.
Many doctors, nurses and other medical staff have lost their lives while treating the patients. Here is a war-like situation. They are also scared about the possibility that they carry the killer virus home and spread it to the family.
Alongside comes the people’s irresponsible behavior, couldn’t-care-less attitude, the mass gatherings, political rallies, cinema craze, all helping spread the deadly virus. All these are happening when the frontline Covid warriors are staking their lives and attending to patients non-stop and gasping for breath.
 
Dr Anita Rego, mental health professional and psychotherapist, said: “As frontline workers they deal with the real miseries of the patients, those who are struggling on their beds, those who are breathing their last. The stories of medical success are often clouded by these realities. We need to build an envelope of caring professionals and psychotherapists on whom they can fall back and build their strength and energy.”
She added: “Providing healthcare workers with stronger networks of specialist mental health services is not yet a priority with our health system and we need to advocate it.”
 
Dr Daljeet Kaur, consultant psychiatrist, said: “There will be frustration, stress and anxiety. The medical staff is disheartened because the situation is not in their control. When it comes to the doctors’ level, the coronavirus variants are unpredictable and it is difficult for them to understand the prognosis of patients.”
“The stress level, though, varies between individual and individual. While a senior doctor might be stressed and overwhelmed, a nursing staff or paramedic on the frontline and spending more time with the patient is more depressed seeing the conditions from close quarters.”
 
She suggested: “Counselors should be allocated for patients and the attenders. This will reduce the load of the consulting doctors. The medical staff should also be counseled on a periodical basis. Mental health of the medical staff should be a priority.”
 
QUOTES
Dr J Shivkumar, senior cardiologist: “The medical professionals are always under stress due to various reasons. Now, in the Covid situation, they are putting their lives on stake and saving the patient, whereas the general public is game with flaunting all the Covid protocols, further straining the health sector facilities.”
 
Dr Ashish Chauhan, Covid care expert at Apollo Hospital: “With an exposure some 100 to 1,000 times more that of the general public, the health care professionals are dead scared while performing their duties. Currently they are working like a soldier, ready to be martyred during a war. A sincere thanks by the patients and their relatives is what they expect.” 
“As per an IMA study, an average Indian doctor lives 10 years lesser than the normal population. Now, some 70 to 80 per cent of the patients are treated and they walkout healthy whereas some 20 to 30 per cent die. This is not an easy sight to digest.”
 
Dr  Karuna Madap, paediatrician, Covid-care: “Health care warriors should protect themselves and their families first. If they are physically and mentally strong, they can take care of hundreds patients. The medical staff should constantly take proper counseling for their mental health from a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist. There should be some organisation to come forward and provide nutritious food for the medical staff.”
Dr Sahithi Reddy Lebaka, junior doctor at Fever Hospital, Nallakunta: “Wearing plastic PPE kits for hours in his summer is not an easy task. Restless extra shifts due to constant patient flow, insufficient medical supplies and instruments, all these mean for us a mental fatigue.”
 
Dr M A Faroqui, professor, PG department of Unani medicine, Tibbi College, Charminar: “On Wednesday, two doctors in this Unani hospital have perished due to Covid-19. Over time, we will be drained out. There has to be equal participation of the public to overcome the present grim situation. When that fails to happen, we become mentally upset.”

"The women of today are focused, feisty and raring to go in pursuit of their true calling. And nothing seems to be holding them back. Because she knows exactly what she wants and is growing increasingly immune to petty criticism and stereotypical judgements.
In a fun chat, a bunch of women speak about the inanest comments that came their way when they chose to follow their heart. And what needs to change, as we celebrate another year of Women’s Day!
 
Don’t need sympathy
I am not a propagator of pushing or breaking the glass ceiling. We harp on and on about the fictional glass ceiling. In my opinion, we create our own reality by owning up to our actions. What glass ceiling are we talking about? It has always been a self-fulfilling prophecy. On one hand, we’re always talking about equality and on the other we expect praise for being a woman entrepreneur. Just like you have ‘a boss’ — not a woman boss or a male boss — you’re an entrepreneur, irrespective of gender. The term ‘woman entrepreneur’ is redundant. Your goals don’t know or care about your gender. Just keep going and rise through to where you ought to be.”
Ami Sata, Founder, Amouve
 
Be happy
One should follow their own soul’s calling. I’ve been told I was a dreamer, crazy, irresponsible and ungrounded just because I chose to do what made me happy. Women are questioned a lot more about their choices, and I really hope that changes. Most women today in my opinion are looking for freedom — and being able to do what you like is true freedom.”
Sheelaa Bajaj, Celebrity numerologist
No room for regression
A male acquaintance once said to me, out of the blue, ‘Honestly, Sanhita, I think you are trying too hard. You could have just put on some make-up, and dressed well and got married to a rich guy so that you don’t have to do anything and enjoy a luxurious life’.
I’ve often been asked when is my Chick Lit book coming out. This women’s day I wish we are inclusive of all genders when we make decisions. But above all, I wish that we are able to create a safe society which is more accepting of all kinds of people so that in the future we no longer need to celebrate a certain day to remind people of what more needs to be done to benefit us all.”
Sanhita Baruah,best-selling author of The Art of Letting Go in Amazon’s poetry category, 2020
 
Take charge of your life
I have heard many comments like ‘That’s interesting! What else do you do?’ Another regular comment is, ‘You must not be married. That’s why you are able to do all this. See how things change after marriage...’.
Truth is I’ve been married for 10 years now. My wish for every woman is to be able to take charge of their lives and be aware of their own capabilities, irrespective of people’s perceptions about them or what they do.”
Shambhavi Singh, (Runs Kaushalya.mantra, a wellness start-up, focuses on holistic health)
 
Freedom from bias
It’s high time people start to take fledgling women entrepreneurs seriously. I was once told that I could enjoy and have fun in life on the pretext of ‘entrepreneurship.’ These were their exact words, ‘No one will even question you. But if you are really serious, then let me tell you, building a sustainable business is not everyone’s cup of tea.’
So, from my experience, when women talk about wanting and finding freedom, it actually starts with the need for freedom against bias and stereotyping.”

"Hyderabad: First there were the mice, and some rats. Then came Syrian hamsters and the rabbits. And finally there were the rhesus macaque monkeys. The lakhs of people receiving Covaxin to keep themselves safe from Covid-19, and to help stop the spread of the disease in India and elsewhere in the world, have much to thank these animals for.
Not just because these animals were the first ones to receive the jabs of the three vaccine candidates developed by scientists at the Bharat Biotech, along with Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).
 
Not just because the animals were deliberately injected with the SARS-CoV-2 to test the efficacy of the candidate vaccines while in their cages in a high security Level 4 biosafety hazard lab at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.
But because at the end of the study periods, each of them was put to sleep for ever before necropsies were performed on their bodies by the scientists who studied what the virus did to the animals and their organs, and how the vaccine candidates worked in controlling the virus in their bodies.
All these animals, unknown to anyone outside of the NIV lab or the scientists involved in the vaccine development — in human terms — made the ultimate sacrifice of giving up their lives so the very humans who put them through the trials, could keep themselves safe from the virus that probably racked their fragile bodies as the vaccines and the virus battled it out in their organs.
 
In three studies, scientists from Bharat Biotech, NIV and ICMR provide great detail about how the trial were conducted, and how the immune response for the candidate vaccines — three versions of the then under-development (during the peak of the lockdown in 2020) Bharat Biotech’s vaccine — was in these animals.
There is a reason why lab grown rats, mice, Syrian hamsters, and rabbits are chosen for the studies. As is also the case with the rhesus macaques. The manner in which the immune responses to a virus in these animals develop, is very close to how a human body responds to a virus. And therein lies the value of testing vaccine candidates on these animals even if it means injecting them with the virus to study how their bodies respond and how the vaccines work in controlling the virus in them.
 
Once the trial is over, even if it is possible to extract tissue samples from various organs without actually killing the animals, their subsequent upkeep and nursing them back to health is a hard task. Since these animals are bred for the express purpose of testing in labs, with the exception of the monkeys, and once the tests are completed they are of no further use for any other tests, they are put to sleep in the most humane way possible, according to a senior scientist well versed with the strict protocols that govern use of animals in labs for such tests.
 
While the rats, mice, rabbits and Syrian hamsters were lab-bred, the rhesus macaques that were used in testing Covaxin candidates were caught in the wild in Maharashtra.
According to the study on the tests conducted on the monkeys, permission from the Office of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Maharashtra state, was obtained for capturing 30 rhesus macaques from the wild. Because a decline in the macaque population was observed in the permitted areas of Maharashtra due to the habitat change “probably imposed by food scarcity during the Covid-19 lockdown period of India (March 25, 2020, till May 31, 2020),” 20 of them — 12 males and 8 females — “were captured using experienced monkey catchers,” the study reported. The research was conducted in compliance with the guidelines laid down by the Committee for the Purpose of Control And Supervision of Experiments on Animals, Government of India, the study said.

"New Delhi: Evil is beguiling, evil geniuses more so. They excite us like tantalising puzzles that we want to examine and solve.  
Writers, film directors, theatre owners and audiences are almost like law enforcement officers in their pursuit to understand psychopaths and that’s why they keep revisiting terrorists, serial killers, rapists -- for yet another peek into their minds, their homes, their rage, and their crimes.
 
But, psychopaths are also cliches.
Almost every exploration of a criminal mind that's been mounted on the big screen or split into episodes for OTT platforms is a trek down a familiar road. En route there are absentee or overbearing parents. Some physical or emotional abuse. There’s unease in mundane, social situations. Solace in solitude. And there’s almost, always, sexual frustration.
Given this template, there is nothing exceptional in the story of Theodore Kaczynski, or as he is better known, Ted Kaczynski, America’s Unabomber. And yet, writer-director Tony Stone’s film Ted K, which had its world premiere at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Monday, stands out.
 
To tell the story of the Unabomber, Stone uses real television clips, Kaczynski’s writings, diary entries — which were copious and in numerical code — and meshes them with an intense, bravura performance by Sharlto Copley.
The South African actor, known for his performance as Wikus van der Merwe in the 2009 science fiction film District 9, carries Ted K with a meticulously studied but intense act that is as discomforting as it is impressive.
He remains in an unrelenting wired state throughout, whether he is raging against the whirring helicopters overhead, the pillage of the earth around him, building a bomb or complaining to a telephone company official about the $5 and few cents that a public phone owes him.
 
We watch, in his body and face, as his complexes, sense of superiority, frustration turn into a raging, mad desire to seek revenge on corporates, technology, one parcel bomb at a time.
Great performances, especially in biopics, are marked by that moment when the actor becomes the character, embodying and portraying all the ugliness and physicality while creating an inner cosmos that we can read in their eyes, in the tiniest change of expression.
Copley as Kaczynski, a mathematics prodigy who joined Harvard University at the age of 16 but then checked out to live by himself in Montana mountains in a 10-by-12 wood cabin, is on the screen throughout. Except for a few brief scenes in the 120-minute film, the camera stays on Copley and there is not a single false note in his compelling act.
 
Among the younger lot in Hollywood, Christian Bale, Leonado de Caprio, Matthew McConaughey, Javier Bardem, Joaquin Phoenix, James Franco and Bradley Cooper are names taken with reverence in terms of how much they give of themselves to a role.
Difficult films with demanding roles can ride on them.
To that hall of fame, Ted K adds the name of Sharlto Copley. He creates the sort of scary, uneasy portrait of a man in constant distress and rage that won’t ever leave you.

"Hyderabad: In the rapidly evolving field of healthcare protocols and advancements in treatments of various diseases and health conditions, two city doctors have been digging deep, down to the genetic information level, in a bid to ensure best possible outcomes for their patients.
“This is the next step in medical care,” says Dr Kalyan Uppuluri, from K&H Personalized Medicine Clinic. He, along with Dr Hima Challa, are the founders of the clinic, the first of its kind in the country to offer services bringing genomic medicine into clinical medicare. Armed with degrees in medical genomics from Stanford University and Harvard Medical School respectively, they say they took a leap of faith two years ago to set up their clinic in the city.
 
“There is enough data at the genetic level of humans to help modern medicine become more precise,” says Dr Hima Challa. “There is very strong objective evidence for this.”
The challenge for them was to translate molecular biology level data into medical language. A team of molecular biologists armed with advanced degrees dug deep into published research and after studying thousands of research papers, gathered data on around 8,000 genes and switched what each of them do and what that means in medical language. “For example, the gene that regulates glycogen provides information on how glucose is released when needed by the body. If there are disorders associated with this, this can be determined by genetic studies. If a person is prone to this problem, then advise can be given that he or she needs to consume carbohydrates before exercises or workouts so energy is available for these tasks,” Dr Hima Challa explained.
 
Genomic medicine helps in determining risk scores for various possible health conditions and these scores remain more or less stable through one’s life. Clinical risk scores can change, and can be changed for the better based on follow up advice from physicians, especially when coupled with knowledge of the genetic risk scores, she says.
“Our view is that personalized medicine is the future. Patients will be in a position, when their doctors have the assistance of genomic medicine, to be assured that they are in a position to achieve the best possible outcomes for their treatment,” says Dr Kalyan Uppuluri.
 
Medicines of the future will evolve based on genomics, he predicts. “We see this already in oncology, for treating cancers. Genomics is already helping in attacking this disease’s pathways,” he says.
On what the future holds, he says that they see their clinic offering their products based on algorithms developed based on genetic information they have complied as well as from their patients so far, to support clinics and hospitals. If clinical medicine is combined with genomic medicine and with proper follow-ups by patients, the treatment outcomes will be much better, help patients overcome their disease and help their doctors prescribe protocols that can better combat their conditions, he says.

"New Delhi: Evil is beguiling, evil geniuses more so. They excite us like tantalising puzzles that we want to examine and solve.  
Writers, film directors, theatre owners and audiences are almost like law enforcement officers in their pursuit to understand psychopaths and that’s why they keep revisiting terrorists, serial killers, rapists -- for yet another peek into their minds, their homes, their rage, and their crimes.
 
But, psychopaths are also cliches.
Almost every exploration of a criminal mind that's been mounted on the big screen or split into episodes for OTT platforms is a trek down a familiar road. En route there are absentee or overbearing parents. Some physical or emotional abuse. There’s unease in mundane, social situations. Solace in solitude. And there’s almost, always, sexual frustration.
Given this template, there is nothing exceptional in the story of Theodore Kaczynski, or as he is better known, Ted Kaczynski, America’s Unabomber. And yet, writer-director Tony Stone’s film Ted K, which had its world premiere at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Monday, stands out.
 
To tell the story of the Unabomber, Stone uses real television clips, Kaczynski’s writings, diary entries — which were copious and in numerical code — and meshes them with an intense, bravura performance by Sharlto Copley.
The South African actor, known for his performance as Wikus van der Merwe in the 2009 science fiction film District 9, carries Ted K with a meticulously studied but intense act that is as discomforting as it is impressive.
He remains in an unrelenting wired state throughout, whether he is raging against the whirring helicopters overhead, the pillage of the earth around him, building a bomb or complaining to a telephone company official about the $5 and few cents that a public phone owes him.
 
We watch, in his body and face, as his complexes, sense of superiority, frustration turn into a raging, mad desire to seek revenge on corporates, technology, one parcel bomb at a time.
Great performances, especially in biopics, are marked by that moment when the actor becomes the character, embodying and portraying all the ugliness and physicality while creating an inner cosmos that we can read in their eyes, in the tiniest change of expression.
Copley as Kaczynski, a mathematics prodigy who joined Harvard University at the age of 16 but then checked out to live by himself in Montana mountains in a 10-by-12 wood cabin, is on the screen throughout. Except for a few brief scenes in the 120-minute film, the camera stays on Copley and there is not a single false note in his compelling act.
 
Among the younger lot in Hollywood, Christian Bale, Leonado de Caprio, Matthew McConaughey, Javier Bardem, Joaquin Phoenix, James Franco and Bradley Cooper are names taken with reverence in terms of how much they give of themselves to a role.
Difficult films with demanding roles can ride on them.
To that hall of fame, Ted K adds the name of Sharlto Copley. He creates the sort of scary, uneasy portrait of a man in constant distress and rage that won’t ever leave you.

"Hyderabad: A recently launched biography of the late N.T. Rama Rao, titled 'Maverick Messaiah', written by journalist Ramesh Kandula, chronicles and analyses the political life of NTR and its impact on both the state and the nation. An objective assessment of the late leader, the book has been well-received for its critical insight and diligent research.
What set NTR apart from later day movie stars entering politics? Is the Telugu Desam a Kamma party meant to empower the community and is it dying? In this two-part interview with Sriram Karri, author Kandula defends the party and explains what set NTR apart.
 
Why did NTR remain the last real actor phenomenon to achieve political success? Tamil superstar Rajanikant has now announced he won’t enter politics, while Chiranjeevi and Pawan Kalyan had great fan networks but could not convert them into political parties that could debut with electoral wins.
Film actors who entered politics in the past, especially M.G. Ramachandran (MGR) and later on, N.T. Rama Rao (NTR), had a strong artistic urge to connect with the people. The social bonding they enjoyed with their audiences was qualitatively different from actors who strayed into politics in recent years. Despite enormous adulation they enjoyed, neither MGR nor NTR took the people for granted when entering politics. Unlike MGR, NTR did not have a political pedigree, but spared no effort in understanding and articulating public issues that impacted the masses.
 
Chiranjeevi enjoyed many advantages but failed to convince the voting public that he was an alternative to the existing set-up. His campaign began with an assumption that he was a chief-minister-in-waiting and he had to just walk through elections to occupy the chair.
While NTR used his celluloid image to reach out to the public, he never relied on his glamour alone. The political content of NTR’s campaign was more focused and serious, while Chiranjeevi’s was more style than substance. I think Pawan Kalyan also suffers from the same failings (as his brother). Actors cannot succeed in politics unless they carry a serious political message.
 
Did the kind of films NTR played, particularly mythologies, give him any advantage? Why did he have such high credibility with masses? What in your estimate justifies calling him a messiah of any kind, even if of a maverick kind?
An interesting aspect of NTR's mythologies were that they were pan-Indian stories, and not directly related to Telugu nationalism and pride that NTR propounded politically. During NTR’s time, screen adaptations of mythologies became known for a distinctive Telugu, which was formal and ceremonial. As several researchers have pointed out, NTR's mastery over language, considered a quintessential Telugu experience, did help in his emergence as a Telugu cultural symbol.
 
My hypothesis is that NTR carried over the linguistic identity of these films into his political campaign, but not his screen 'divinity'. His political credibility was not a by-product of his playing godly characters. He worked towards it consciously both in his film career and later on in politics.
As for the tag of messiah, NTR burst on to the political scene in 1982 as a ray of hope and captivated the imagination of the Telugus like no other leader. His campaigns were the greatest spectacles of democracy in action. Shortcomings notwithstanding, NTR emerged as a larger-than-life personality and brought a sea-change in the socio-political landscape of AP.
 
The maverick apart, NTR was a man of strange contradictions. He believed in the power of people, but his democratic credentials were suspect because he had no qualms in turning his party into a one-man show. He was secular to the core but exhibited a peculiar religious streak. He entered politics on the plank of regionalism but remained a committed nationalist throughout.
How did people relate to his dramatics and eccentricities?
His dramatics entertained the masses but some sections of people intensely disliked the theatrics he brought into politics. He carried this urge to be the centre of attraction from reel to public life. However, common folks were not particularly put off by this, because of his ability to convey seriousness of intent. Despite the nickname 'Drama Rao', NTR was a very serious man in private and rarely cracked a joke. But a common person felt warmth in his presence.

"Hyderabad: Sirisha Bandla, 34-year-old aeronautical engineer, is one among the 5 astronauts to fly into space with billionaire Richard Branson on board Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo Unity.
Bandla is also the third Indian-origin woman to head to space after Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams.
 
Born in Andhra Pradesh's Guntur and brought up in Houston, Texas, Bandla will join Branson and four others to make a journey to the space from New Mexico.
""I am so incredibly honored to be a part of the amazing crew of #Unity22, and to be a part of a company whose mission is to make space available to all,"" Bandla tweeted when the mission was announced.
""I really didn't need to tweet this since my friends flooded the feed yesterday with itRed heartI was overwhelmed (in a good way!) by messages of love, unrecognizable capital text, and positivity yesterday. Slowly working my way through them...one platform at a time!"" she added.

Bandla will be astronaut no 004 and her flight role will be Researcher Experience, according to her profile on Virgin Galactic.
""When I first heard that I was getting this opportunity, it was just. I think that that probably captured it very well, I was speechless. This is an incredible opportunity to get people from different backgrounds, different geographies and different communities into space,"" she said in a video posted on Virgin Galactic Twitter on July 6.
 
Speaking about the experience, Bandla said it was ""incredible"" and ""life-changing"" experience to see Earth from space.
""I am kind of still up there but it's so glad to be here. I was trying to think about a better word than incredible but that is the only word that can come to my mind... Seeing the view of Earth is so life-changing but also the boost the rocket motor kicking in. The whole trip to space and back is just amazing, Bandla told the NBC News in an interview.
Bandla described the moment as emotional and said, ""I have been dreaming of going to space since I was young and literally it is a dream come true.""
 
""I have wanted to be an astronaut but I wasn't able to go in the traditional National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) role and I took a very unconventional way to go to space and I do believe that a lot of people are going to be able to experience this and that's why we are here,"" she added.

On being asked if this was just a joyride for rich people, she said, ""As Virgin Galactic builds up...this is VSS Unity's ride to space today but we have got two more spaceships in the manufacture and we hope the cost would come down.""
Virgin Galactic  — the business Branson started in 2004  — aims to fly private citizens to the edge of space. The trips are designed to permit passengers to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and observe the curvature of Earth.
The Virgin Galactic carrier can launch up to eight people (two pilots and six passengers) on the Unity 22 flight, but on Sunday there were only six occupants (two pilots and four passengers).

"Hyderabad: Veteran Bollywood actor Dilip Kumar who breathed his last on Wednesday at the age of 98 had his share of bittersweet memories of Hyderabad. He married a Hyderabadi woman Asma Rahman sometime in 1980, though he was already married to Saira Banu. Dilip Kumar said a conspiracy was hatched that forced him to marry Asma Rahman.
Saira Banu was reportedly not aware of Dilip Kumar’s marriage with Asma. She came to know about it in 1982 when a tabloid made this sensational revelation. Though Saira Banu was pained to hear the news, she stood by Dilip Kumar when he had admitted his mistake and sought her time to undo the wrong through proper legal process and restore the sanctity of their marriage. Later Dilip Kumar divorced Asma.
 
Dilip Kumar had inaugurated the Owaisi Hospital & Research Centre managed by All India Majlis Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen in 1996. At a young age, Dilip Kumar used to visit Hyderabad. He had attended a few functions and wedding ceremonies held in Hyderabad. Dilip Kumar also contributed to the development of the Deccan Medical College.

"Hyderabad: The city’s air is rife with Nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This is contrary to popular belief that the lockdown has helped improve the air quality, an analysis conducted by Greenpeace India Society has found.
Nitrogen dioxide pollution is known to cause damage to the human respiratory tract, cause asthma and make a person vulnerable to other respiratory infections. The study said there was growing evidence that polluted cities suffered disproportionately more from coronavirus cases.
 
Increased concentrations of NO2, Greenpeace said, were found not just in Hyderabad but across several cities in India during the current Covid19 pandemic.
The report published on Wednesday said: “In Hyderabad, nitrogen dioxide air pollution was 69 per cent higher in April 2021 than in the same month the previous year. A part of this difference is attributable to changing weather conditions. After removing the effect of weather, there is still an increase of 38 per cent which is attributed to an increase in emissions.”
After a year since the initial Covid lockdown went into effect, NO2 pollution has increased in eight Indian cities -- Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Lucknow.
 
According to satellite observations, NO2 pollution in Hyderabad increased by 69 per cent between April 2020 and April 2021. The weather had only a little of the contribution to this change. In Delhi, NO2 was higher by 125 per cent, Chennai by 94 per cent Mumbai by 52 per cent, Bengaluru by 90 per cent Kolkata by 11 per cent, Jaipur by 47 per cent and Lucknow by 32 per cent in April 2021 than in the same month the previous year
While there was an opinion that the weather conditions would abate the pollution, the result drawn out in the study showed that despite taking the weather conditions into account,  NO2 pollution occurred. This was primarily due to changes in emissions, while weather influence was only of secondary importance in most places,” it said.
 
According to Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner with Greenpeace India, “The air quality levels in these cities are alarming. People saw clean skies and breathed fresh air during the nationwide lockdown though it was an unintended consequence of the pandemic. The disruption caused by the pandemic is a case for transition to cleaner, equitable and sustainable decentralised energy sources such as rooftop solar and clean and sustainable mobility. The recovery from the pandemic must not come at the expense of a return to previous levels of air pollution.”

"Thiruvananthapuram: Tourists coming to Kerala will now be able to savour delicious local cuisine while sitting in the comfort of their cars as the state Tourism Department launched in-car dining to boost tourism and also to meet the challenges of COVID-19.
The restaurants run by Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) across the state will cater to tourists with in-car dining.
 
To know how it feels like dining in a car, Kerala Tourism Minister PA Mohammed Riyas himself had his favourite dishes sitting inside his car.
""The in-car dining is a project designed to give a boost to Kerala tourism sector hit badly by COVID-19. To revive we are launching this project by which tourists coming to Kerala will be able to use this service. Amid COVID-19 pandemic, instead of dining inside a restaurant and mingling with the crowd, such a project will also ensure safety,"" said Riyas.
Kayamkulam MLA U Pratibha also joined the minister during the launch of the project.
 
This venture comes at a time when tourism, which is a mainstay of Kerala that contributes to 11 per cent to state SDP, incurred loss due to COVID-19.
To overcome the crisis, the Kerala government also has mooted the idea of complete vaccinated tourism and also to find new tourism destinations.
The Tourism Minister said the state has initiated a project in which a new destination will be identified in every Panchayat. There are also projects in the pipeline to develop new heritage and pilgrim tourism destinations to attract maximum domestic travellers.

"New Delhi: “Matrimonial ad by a feminist” is an oxymoron. These advertisements are often sexist and casteist, putting emphasis on attributes like caste, class, height, and the colour of one’s skin, and using salary and other wealth related attributes to appeal to potential matrimonial partners.
However, a matrimonial advertisement “by a feminist” went viral after comedian Aditi Mittal tweeted about it, bringing the advertisement into the limelight.
 
The advertisement read: “Match for opinionated feminist. 30+ educated girl, short hair, piercings, works in the social sector against capitalism. Wanted handsome, well-built, strictly 25-28 years old only son with established business, bungalow/at least 20 acre farmhouse. Should know cooking. No farters/burpers please. Write to curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com.”
The advertisement, obviously fake, was a prank to emphasise the sexist and misogynistic ideology behind matrimonial advertisements. The owners of the email curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com- under the pseudonyms Sakshi, her brother Srijan and her best friend Damyanti- told BBC that it was a prank played on Sakshi for her 30th birthday.
 
""Turning 30 is a milestone, especially because of all the conversation in our society around marriage. As you turn 30, your family and society start putting pressure on you to get married and settle down,"" Srijan said.
However, once the advertisement went viral, it reopened the debate of the sexism and misogyny of matrimonial ads. Though she did receive many positive emails, Sakshi claimed that there were a plethora of hate emails sent her way as the ad hurt a lot of fragile egos, ranging from feminism-bashers to trolls sending death threats over a prank.
 
""You can't say such things out loud. Men ask for tall, slim beautiful brides all the time, they brag about their wealth, but when the tables are turned, they can't stomach it.

"Hyderabad: It was a chance discovery, says Dr Kumar Eswaran, a mathematical physicist in the city, who claims to have found the solution to the Riemann Hypothesis, a millennium problem in mathematics. It was waiting for proof for 161 years, Dr Eswaran told this newspaper.
The Riemann Hypothesis, touted to be number one out of the top 10 unsolved mathematical problems, was designated as a millennium problem in 2000, with a reward of $1 million from Clay Mathematics Institute, Oxford, England, for anyone who could solve it.
 
""It was, in fact, back in 2016, that I first gave proof for the formula improved by the great mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann in the 1800s. I had put it on the web for open review and downloads after working on it for about six weeks. During 2018-19, I gave several lectures on the proof,” Dr Eswaran, 74, who is with the Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Hyderabad, said.
The Riemann Hypothesis, in the simplest possible explanation, relates to how prime numbers are distributed. This has been a problem that has challenged mathematicians for generations. According to mathematicians who have grappled with the hypothesis, proof of the Riemann Hypothesis would have far-reaching consequences for number theory and for the use of primes in cryptography, and would automatically lead to the proof of numerous theorems which are dependent on the truth of this hypothesis.
 
In Dr Eswaran's methodology, the ‘factorisation sequence of numbers’ was shown to be like a 'random walk', he said. ""This method used was actually not just number theories. I had to use techniques from random variables and probability as well,"" Dr Eswaran added.  
An expert committee of scientists including Dr T. Ramasami, former secretary, Union ministry of science and technology, Prof. P. Narasimha Reddy, executive director, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Prof. M. Seetharaman, former professor and Chair, department of theoretical physics, University of Madras, Prof. V. Srinivasan, former professor and dean, School of Physics, UoH, Prof. K. Srinivasa Rao, former senior professor, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, Prof. M. D. Srinivas, senior Fellow, Centre for Policy Studies, Prof. Vinayak Eswaran, department of mechanical and aerospace engineering, IIT Hyderabad, and Dr Adindla Suma, associate professor, department of computer science, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology conducted an open review of the proof for a year from February 2020 to conclude that Dr Eswaran had indeed proved the Riemann Hypothesis.  
 
The committee invited more than 1,200 mathematicians to participate in an open review of the presented proof. The review was open in the sense that the referees had to be willing to have their names and institutional affiliations openly revealed, so that nothing is done anonymously, and nothing can be said that would not be openly available for all other experts to see.
Dr Eswaran said in his experience this had been the most fair and robust way to get the proposed proof assessed. The expert committee then examined the comments of the reviewers and the responses of the author. In their final meeting held on May 16, the committee concluded that Dr Eswaran’s proof of the Riemann Hypothesis is correct.
 
The committee also ruled that the proof, the referees’ comments, and the author’s responses in their entirety, without any redactions, should be published in the form of an e-book and made available to the public at large and then followed, a few months later, by a hard copy.

"Thiruvananthapuram: Tourists coming to Kerala will now be able to savour delicious local cuisine while sitting in the comfort of their cars as the state Tourism Department launched in-car dining to boost tourism and also to meet the challenges of COVID-19.
The restaurants run by Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) across the state will cater to tourists with in-car dining.
 
To know how it feels like dining in a car, Kerala Tourism Minister PA Mohammed Riyas himself had his favourite dishes sitting inside his car.
""The in-car dining is a project designed to give a boost to Kerala tourism sector hit badly by COVID-19. To revive we are launching this project by which tourists coming to Kerala will be able to use this service. Amid COVID-19 pandemic, instead of dining inside a restaurant and mingling with the crowd, such a project will also ensure safety,"" said Riyas.
Kayamkulam MLA U Pratibha also joined the minister during the launch of the project.
 
This venture comes at a time when tourism, which is a mainstay of Kerala that contributes to 11 per cent to state SDP, incurred loss due to COVID-19.
To overcome the crisis, the Kerala government also has mooted the idea of complete vaccinated tourism and also to find new tourism destinations.
The Tourism Minister said the state has initiated a project in which a new destination will be identified in every Panchayat. There are also projects in the pipeline to develop new heritage and pilgrim tourism destinations to attract maximum domestic travellers.

"ANANTAPUR: Lack of rains yet in parts of Rayalaseema has led to rural people enacting the centuries-old tradition of protesting against the Rain God with “Karuvu Rallu” or drought stones.
As per the tradition, villagers in this drought-prone region throw waste material of their village, including the drought stones, on outskirts of another village to appease the Rain God into showering rains. Villagers, however, exercise caution while throwing the drought stones, lest it lead to a clash with members of the targeted village.
 
All such stones are finally dumped into Penna and other rivers of Rayalaseema bordering Karnataka. Senior citizens say this tradition has been continuing even to this day, as the practise not only appeases the Rain God but also checks farmers from falling into depression due to their inability in raising crops.
This Deccan Chronicle reporter saw a dump of drought stones on outskirts of Seebai village in Kalyanadurgam mandal of Anantapur district. They must have been dumped there by inmates of one of the villages trying to appease the Rain God.
 
Rajanna from Kalayandurgam area said this tradition has been a part of Rayalaseema farmers’ life for many centuries. Karuvu Rallu on outskirts of another village are seen as a positive sign.
Dr. Harinath Reddy of Rayalaseema Vedika says this tradition of protest is mostly seen in villages around Goddess Gangamma temples, which are constructed mostly close to river beds and irrigation tanks. “At these temples, villagers seeking rains offer traditional poojas and ululate to express their grief at lack of rains”, Dr Reddy explained.
 
According to reports available, many areas of Rayalaseema have experienced 72 drought years in the past 145 years. Such high variability in southwest monsoon is an indicator of the risk associated with farming in this district. It has 7 lakh hectares of dry land whose cultivators depend only on seasonal rains.

"New Delhi: “Matrimonial ad by a feminist” is an oxymoron. These advertisements are often sexist and casteist, putting emphasis on attributes like caste, class, height, and the colour of one’s skin, and using salary and other wealth related attributes to appeal to potential matrimonial partners.
However, a matrimonial advertisement “by a feminist” went viral after comedian Aditi Mittal tweeted about it, bringing the advertisement into the limelight.
 
The advertisement read: “Match for opinionated feminist. 30+ educated girl, short hair, piercings, works in the social sector against capitalism. Wanted handsome, well-built, strictly 25-28 years old only son with established business, bungalow/at least 20 acre farmhouse. Should know cooking. No farters/burpers please. Write to curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com.”
The advertisement, obviously fake, was a prank to emphasise the sexist and misogynistic ideology behind matrimonial advertisements. The owners of the email curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com- under the pseudonyms Sakshi, her brother Srijan and her best friend Damyanti- told BBC that it was a prank played on Sakshi for her 30th birthday.
 
""Turning 30 is a milestone, especially because of all the conversation in our society around marriage. As you turn 30, your family and society start putting pressure on you to get married and settle down,"" Srijan said.
However, once the advertisement went viral, it reopened the debate of the sexism and misogyny of matrimonial ads. Though she did receive many positive emails, Sakshi claimed that there were a plethora of hate emails sent her way as the ad hurt a lot of fragile egos, ranging from feminism-bashers to trolls sending death threats over a prank.
 
""You can't say such things out loud. Men ask for tall, slim beautiful brides all the time, they brag about their wealth, but when the tables are turned, they can't stomach it. How could a woman set such criteria?"" She added, ""[The ad] was a satirical statement on this narrative and I assume that the people getting triggered are the same as those who put out these kinds of 'slim, fair, beautiful bride wanted' type of ads in the first place"".
And for those upset by an obvious prank, she asks: ""Do you send such triggered emails to all the sexist, casteist 'bride wanted' adverts that appear in the papers everyday? If not, then you need to curb your patriarchy"".

"Hyderabad: Milkha Singh made waves at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, but his baby steps as a sprinter were taken here in Secunderabad, where he was recruited in the Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (EME) of the Army back in 1952.
The ’Flying Sikh’ died of Covid complications late on Saturday night. He was 91.
 
He trained in and around the EME Centre area, building his strength and stamina by taking up many an uphill task — he would run up the Ammuguda hill carrying a stone-filled bag and also run alongside a train, which ran on the then metre gauge track between Bolaram and Ammuguda. “The driver of a particular train used to encourage and egg me on. It was kind of a motivation and I could run for a longer distance,” Milkha recalled in interviews later.
He has always credited the Army, EME and Secunderabad Cantonment for his sporting success. “Had I not joined the Army I would not have worked so hard,” Milkha said.
 
Fittingly, a colony in the EME Centre is named after him, as also the Stadium inside the EME Centre where he trained. While inaugurating the Milkha Singh Stadium in 2014, the legend had got emotional, kissed the turf and said it was like a gurudwara to him.
Secunderabad, where Milkha lived from 1952 to 1960 and prepared for the 1960 Olympics at which he missed the 400 metres bronze medal by a whisker, was always special to him. “Whenever he came across athletes from Secunderabad/ Hyderabad, he would develop an instant affinity. ‘Mai Secunderabad ka rice khaney ke baad running start kiya’ (I have started running after eating rice in Secunderabad) he once told me in jest. He would also talk about his many memories here,” Prabhakara Rao Mulagala, veteran long-distance runner from the city, told this newspaper.
 
“We should also remember Milkha used to run on cinder tracks, not on the present synthetic ones that give athletes the advantage of up to a second. He was the first to run the 400m under 46 seconds, at a meet in Oslo (Norway) a fortnight or so before the Rome Olympics, where he was unfortunate to finish fourth, 0.1 second behind Malcolm Spence of South Africa. Later, South Africa was banned from sport for 36 years because of apartheid... that bronze could’ve belonged to Milkha, who competed against the world’s best,” added Prabhakara, who has won 300-plus gold medals at national and international races, and at 69 still competes in races.

"Hyderabad: If a scriptwriter had proposed a few years ago a logline for a movie which read – an actor from Punjabi, with a six-pack body, who has played a villain on screen for over two decades, finds a calling in the midst of a pandemic.
His real-life works make him the most beloved superstar across the country, the trust in him built rapidly as he works to connect, first with migrant workers and trying to help them, and as a second wave hits, responding to people from across the country, reaching out to him with a trust they repose in him greater than in governments. And in cineaste Telugu states, gods of decades slide down the charts, downed by a virus, leaving only one real star.
 
Such a script would never have found a director accepting it. Even the audiences would have found it beyond plausibility, even for a story. But when life scripts stories and reality screens it, not for two hours but years, anything is possible. Such has been the script starring Sonu Sood since Coronavirus spread its menacing tentacles and brought down every order of society and all semblances of sanity.
But in dark times, heroes arise from unexpected spots. Lending help, giving hope, sharing light, redefining love, and metamorphosing fan following.
 
Speaking to Deccan Chronicle about his inner motivations to emerge from the fringes of celebritydom to becoming a trusted icon of a ravage nation’s people, Sonu Sood, in a soft soothing voice of a healer rather than a preferred negative actor of the movie screen, said, “growing up in Moga, Punjab, I saw my mother, a teacher, give free tuition classes for decades. Outside my father’s shop, there would always be a langar, where I too would serve food. It was a lesson ingrained for life that you must always be there to serve in whatever capacity you have.”
 
When asked about the incident that prompted him to emerge out of lockdown and pandemic fears to become a frontline hero, Mr Sood said, “last year, when I started hearing stories of migrant workers, I knew I could no longer sit in the security and comfort of my home. As a migrant worker myself, though privileged and lucky, I could empathise with their angst. It started with serving food and giving basic financial help to organising to help them in larger numbers.”
The legend grew quickly because of the vacuum. None of India’s conventional heroes – film stars, cricketers, billionaires – were there to really make a significant difference. Sood’s rise in being recognised as a saviour is also a deep reflection of the indifference of the others.
 
How do you feel about being recognised and trusted so much by people that they tag you on twitter for help before government agencies or ministers? Do you feel pressure to deliver?
He smiles, and in one of the most humane voices I have heard in a long time, replies, “there is no pressure when a friend or family member expects you to stand for them. It is no different. Every bit of time, money and effort I can muster, I am out there because I know somewhere, someone who has reached out to me is waiting and expecting. It is a call I must respond to, and I can’t let them down.”
 
I scratch my head, a bit bewildered. Is it a mere PR exercise? Or did I get connected to Dalia Lama by mistake? It is, I do not think it is his fault that others in the cine world have used charity as a ticket to sell more tickets for their next release. Last year, we were stuck with the tragic story of another SS in Bollywood – Sushant Singh. This SS has risen now to become India’s superhero, without a cape, just a twitter handle.
Are you a bit embarrassed Sonu, I ask him, that others in your film fraternity, Bollywood or Tollywood, who have received greater stardom and earned far more money and influence, never cared to take up work like yours in one of our worst years ever? He answers candidly, but with sangfroid. “You can’t force a feeling of wanting to help people. It can’t even be taught beyond a point. It must come from within.”
 
What next? Will this image harm your film career? Next time any film fans see him on screen as a villain, will the portrayal be convincing? “I am not thinking of the next film. Just my next SOS call.”
He disappears to do good for someone, somewhere. A villain has refined heroism, forever. My vote for the biggest star in films in India in a dark year – Sonu Sood.

"Nellore: The Ayush department team studying the concoction prepared by Bonigi Anandaiah at Krishnapatnam and hawked as a cure for Covid-19 cannot be termed an Ayurvedic medicine.
They said that Ayush protocols and guidelines do not accept these preparations as Ayurvedic drugs. They felt that the preparations were similar to traditional local medicines, hinting that there is no need for any licence.
 
Speaking to this newspaper, Commissioner of Ayush and head of the team, Col. V. Ramulu, said that there are no harmful ingredients in the substance being given by Anandaiah, including the eye drops.
“Anandaiah prepared all them before us and the process is very simple for anyone to produce. Moreover, he is willing to share the formula with the public,” he said.
The Ayush official said that Anandaiah has been using herbs including locally available leaves such as neem, mango and jamun apart from honey, pepper, green camphor, nutmeg, black cumin, turmeric and cinnamon among many other items, “which we use daily for preparing food items.”
 
In the eye drops, Anandaiah has been using pepper, mulla vankaya and honey, Col Ramulu noted. He said that the preparation cannot be prescribed for Covid-19 as the formula is one among hundreds of local remedies for different ailments. Citing an instance, he pointed to the popular Puttur treatment for broken bones.
Col Ramulu said they would submit a report to the government on their study. It is up to the government to take a decision, he added.

"Hyderabad: On turning 43 in May two year ago, Pushpak, a highly successful senior executive with a global fin-tech firm located in the Financial District, made several changes in his lifestyle. These included getting a farm house in the town, buying a new SUV and promising to block his calendar for a family holiday abroad.
His fitness goals included joining a gym, cycling and running. His life revolved around the stress of managing his own wealth portfolio as also his financial goals and ambitions.
 
Two years later, the SUV means far less to him. His farmhouse seems a trifle less important.
He has lost two members in his extended family, a close friend and several friends. He has failed at least in one case; despite all the money, he failed to get an ICU bed for a close relative in another city.
He now has a new priority; having peace of mind. After many trials, he has chosen an unlikely route – meditation – to achieve his goal.
Speaking on the eve of World Meditation Day, Pushpak says, “I knew it but missed the significance of such an elementary truth in life. Life is all about breathing. We breathe, we are alive. For all my life, I took it for granted. Today, anxiety and stress, fear and worry are all taking a toll on my life. Corona has raised questions on what we thought was our success. The calm of being aware of my own breath has been the greatest learning.”
 
He’s alone now. Hordes of people have been forced by the pandemic and its continuing challenges to seek and find mental peace through meditation.
Kamala Chirravuri, one of the top-notch yoga meditation teachers in Hyderabad, has celebrities -- those with serious mental issues and corporate executives -- seeking her help. She offers them counseling and personalized yoga-meditation solutions.
“Meditation as defined by Patanjali comprises dharana and dhyana. Dharana is singularly focusing all our conscious attention on one object, the starting point of meditation. Dhyana is the highest level we can achieve, wherein we are immersed and become one with the flow,” she says.
 
When asked about her heightened interest in meditation, Kamala replies, “It feels like we are in the midst of a mythological pralaya. To face the unrest outside, we must find strength, peace and calm within. Once we learn to focus our attention within, and become aware of our breath, we find a center and we reduce the imbalance that causes stress, anxiety and unrest.”
A trainer in the Krishnamacharya tradition, Kamala is comfortable with the diversity of meditation techniques. “There are many techniques from Vipassana, the focus on breath and sensations, to chanting of ‘Om’ to visualizations. Anything that works for you! But the one constant in life is our breathing.”
 
Sanjay Sehgal, a director at Heartfulness, says, “In our technique, we begin with thought as a focal point and dive deeper into the heart. This is a 76-years-old technique of diving deeper and achieving a higher level of consciousness.”
He says, “People may reach out for various reasons. Relieving your stress or finding peace is easy. I often say, you can find peace with a peg of good whiskey or if you can avoid fighting with your spouse. But finding sustainable inner peace, to be a better person, is harder, which is where we take you to.”
 
The heart-centred meditation, which has millions of practitioners, over 14,000 trainers and over 260 ashrams in 130 nations, renders its service all free.
When quizzed about the recent spurt in interest, Sehgal says, “Even a basic practice of pranayamam will help you at a physical level. It expands your lungs and eases the flow of air from your nose to inside. It can most certainly help during Covid times. Bad things can happen to anyone. But a great gift of meditation is that it helps you alter and find a better sense of control over your own reactions and responses. I have seen in my own family that those who meditate had a distinctly different and qualitatively better response to the emergencies arising out of the Covid pandemic than to those who don’t meditate.”
 
Trainers have adopted technology in the Covid season to ensure that meditation can be taught in the virtual mode. From an institutional meditation like Heartfulness, whose global headquarters is in Hyderabad and whose spiritual leader Daaji has held remote virtual sessions to individual trainers like Kamala, to those who are doing sessions through Zoom or Google Meets, technology is helping bring together the agitated with those who guide you to inner peace.

"Nellore: The Ayush department team studying the concoction prepared by Bonigi Anandaiah at Krishnapatnam and hawked as a cure for Covid-19 cannot be termed an Ayurvedic medicine.
They said that Ayush protocols and guidelines do not accept these preparations as Ayurvedic drugs. They felt that the preparations were similar to traditional local medicines, hinting that there is no need for any licence.
 
Speaking to this newspaper, Commissioner of Ayush and head of the team, Col. V. Ramulu, said that there are no harmful ingredients in the substance being given by Anandaiah, including the eye drops.
“Anandaiah prepared all them before us and the process is very simple for anyone to produce. Moreover, he is willing to share the formula with the public,” he said.
The Ayush official said that Anandaiah has been using herbs including locally available leaves such as neem, mango and jamun apart from honey, pepper, green camphor, nutmeg, black cumin, turmeric and cinnamon among many other items, “which we use daily for preparing food items.”
 
In the eye drops, Anandaiah has been using pepper, mulla vankaya and honey, Col Ramulu noted. He said that the preparation cannot be prescribed for Covid-19 as the formula is one among hundreds of local remedies for different ailments. Citing an instance, he pointed to the popular Puttur treatment for broken bones.
Col Ramulu said they would submit a report to the government on their study. It is up to the government to take a decision, he added.

"Hyderabad: A few organisations are striving hard to make sure that frontline warriors against Covid-19 pandemic and other caregivers are not deprived of food, groceries and other bare necessities during their fight against the pandemic.
One such organisation, Give Hope Foundation, in association with a privately operated restaurant, started a campaign to help frontline Covid workers each day. As a part of its drive, the members of the organisation are providing protective gear, masks and nutritious healthy meals to them. Anybody can participate and donate groceries and other food items by scanning the Give Hope Foundation QR code.
 
Speaking to this newspaper, Vasumana Ghosh, a representative of the organisation said, “We have been active for some time, but in the last two weeks we have had some tremendous response for the drive.”
“We have conducted various activities like supplying food and groceries to at old-age homes, orphanages, GHMC workers and schools during these Covid times,” she said.  
During the pandemic, the group has distributed Rs 1.5 lakh worth masks and sanitisers to law and order departments, traffic police, GHMC workers and sanitation workers, she added.

"HYDERABAD: The air inside is cool, but thick with Coronavirus. Among the 13 patients in a Covid-19 ICU, some are on ventilators as their bodies wracked by the virus try and fight back the disease.
The sight is pathetic. The tube inside the throat adds to their cough. Each time a patient coughs, countless virus particles are spewed into the air.
 
Inside the blue full body protection kits, doctors, nurses and other support staff go about their tasks methodically. At stake are the lives of infected patients who, along with their families, have placed their faith in god the almighty and the hospital staff.
The staff in attendance is practising a new regimen of long shifts on slim meals and controlled fluid intake. “If anyone wants to take a break, they will take off the PPE kits and spend 20 minutes in the restroom and spend another 20 minutes putting on a fresh kit. In the meanwhile, we need to find a replacement for that person for a similar duration,” explained Dr K. Subba Reddy, chief intensivist at Apollo Hospital.
 
Last year, when patients began streaming into the ICU at Apollo in Jubilee Hills, there was fear and apprehension among the staff. Everyone was worried and scared. It was Annapurna, a senior housekeeping staffer, who gave the medics the confidence to carry on.
“I had attended to the requirements of TB, AIDS and Chicken Pox patients. We overcame those situations with courage and we can overcome this too,” she had told them. “That gave us a lot of motivation and strength. Then there was one of our nurses Pyun Su Klin, who lost her sister and brother in the first wave. Yet, she said she will not take a break or go home, but continued to work, saying there were so many pat-ients around to be taken care of,” Dr Subba Reddy recalled. While the stress of working to save lives every minute is itself a challenging experience, so is it that an ICU staffer cannot mingle with own family as a matter of precaution.
 
The air in a Covid-19 ICU is thick with the virus. Intubated patients are coughing, generating aerosols carrying the virus particles.
Subba Reddy, over the past one year, has only been seeing his 11-year-old daughter from a distance, in a different apartment where she lives with her grandparents. Going nearer meant a risk to the child.
Coming off a prolonged 72-hour shift, Dr K. Swarna Deepak, also of Apollo, told Deccan Chronicle on Sunday: “Sometimes you just cannot take a break. Over the last couple of days, we opened more ICUs for Covid patients.”
 
And if a hospital runs out of ventilators, the doctors and nurses would resort to sheer physical stamina, drawing every ounce of strength they have to keep a patient alive.
Using a bag ventilator, they keep pumping, squeezing the bag to push oxygen into a patient’s lungs. “And when one arm gets tired, you just switch arms and continue. As long as it takes,” Dr Deepak said.
Elsewhere, at KIMS hospital, Dr Sambit Sahu, a critical and intensive care specialist, talks wistfully of what the scene was just a few weeks ago. “We barely had three patients in the Covid19 ICU. Then it hit us like a storm. All of a sudden, it was 50 patients; and by the time we realised what was happening, we had a 100 of them in these ICUs,” he said.
 
Unlike last year, Covid19 was a novel disease and what everyone heard about it came from other parts of the world. The second wave is different. There was a sense of mental fatigue, of coming out of a stressful year. “We just got out of a traumatic year. And the feeling as the patients began pouring in was Oh God! Not Again!,” Dr Sahu said.
As the virus keeps flying around in the ICUs, the doctors have just one prayer on their lips; that they be able to save the life of every patient and that people at large followed the safety measures and helped medical professionals by keeping the case loads low.
 
“If that does not happen soon, we are in for a disaster,” said Dr Subba Reddy.

"Hyderabad: On turning 43 in May two year ago, Pushpak, a highly successful senior executive with a global fin-tech firm located in the Financial District, made several changes in his lifestyle. These included getting a farm house in the town, buying a new SUV and promising to block his calendar for a family holiday abroad.
His fitness goals included joining a gym, cycling and running. His life revolved around the stress of managing his own wealth portfolio as also his financial goals and ambitions.
 
Two years later, the SUV means far less to him. His farmhouse seems a trifle less important.
He has lost two members in his extended family, a close friend and several friends. He has failed at least in one case; despite all the money, he failed to get an ICU bed for a close relative in another city.
He now has a new priority; having peace of mind. After many trials, he has chosen an unlikely route – meditation – to achieve his goal.
Speaking on the eve of World Meditation Day, Pushpak says, “I knew it but missed the significance of such an elementary truth in life. Life is all about breathing. We breathe, we are alive. For all my life, I took it for granted. Today, anxiety and stress, fear and worry are all taking a toll on my life. Corona has raised questions on what we thought was our success. The calm of being aware of my own breath has been the greatest learning.”
 
He’s alone now. Hordes of people have been forced by the pandemic and its continuing challenges to seek and find mental peace through meditation.
Kamala Chirravuri, one of the top-notch yoga meditation teachers in Hyderabad, has celebrities -- those with serious mental issues and corporate executives -- seeking her help. She offers them counseling and personalized yoga-meditation solutions.
“Meditation as defined by Patanjali comprises dharana and dhyana. Dharana is singularly focusing all our conscious attention on one object, the starting point of meditation. Dhyana is the highest level we can achieve, wherein we are immersed and become one with the flow,” she says.
 
When asked about her heightened interest in meditation, Kamala replies, “It feels like we are in the midst of a mythological pralaya. To face the unrest outside, we must find strength, peace and calm within. Once we learn to focus our attention within, and become aware of our breath, we find a center and we reduce the imbalance that causes stress, anxiety and unrest.”
A trainer in the Krishnamacharya tradition, Kamala is comfortable with the diversity of meditation techniques. “There are many techniques from Vipassana, the focus on breath and sensations, to chanting of ‘Om’ to visualizations. Anything that works for you! But the one constant in life is our breathing.”
 
Sanjay Sehgal, a director at Heartfulness, says, “In our technique, we begin with thought as a focal point and dive deeper into the heart. This is a 76-years-old technique of diving deeper and achieving a higher level of consciousness.”
He says, “People may reach out for various reasons. Relieving your stress or finding peace is easy. I often say, you can find peace with a peg of good whiskey or if you can avoid fighting with your spouse. But finding sustainable inner peace, to be a better person, is harder, which is where we take you to.”
 
The heart-centred meditation, which has millions of practitioners, over 14,000 trainers and over 260 ashrams in 130 nations, renders its service all free.
When quizzed about the recent spurt in interest, Sehgal says, “Even a basic practice of pranayamam will help you at a physical level. It expands your lungs and eases the flow of air from your nose to inside. It can most certainly help during Covid times. Bad things can happen to anyone. But a great gift of meditation is that it helps you alter and find a better sense of control over your own reactions and responses. I have seen in my own family that those who meditate had a distinctly different and qualitatively better response to the emergencies arising out of the Covid pandemic than to those who don’t meditate.”
 
Trainers have adopted technology in the Covid season to ensure that meditation can be taught in the virtual mode. From an institutional meditation like Heartfulness, whose global headquarters is in Hyderabad and whose spiritual leader Daaji has held remote virtual sessions to individual trainers like Kamala, to those who are doing sessions through Zoom or Google Meets, technology is helping bring together the agitated with those who guide you to inner peace.

"HYDERABAD: Doctors and nurses attending to Covid-19 patients and posting their videos on social media sum up the trauma they experience in Covid wards, where the pandemic is staging a dance of death and devastation. End of the day, they often break down into tears.
Medical professionals handling the dying patients say counseling their families on the wait outside is itself a huge task and painful experience. Cases are one too many, hospitals are running out of beds, there is shortage of support systems and life-saving equipment, and the virus’s variants are often difficult to identify.
 
The medical staff is face-to-face with death and strained also by the extra hours of work day after day, in iterations. Worse, they are exposed closer to this deadly virus than the general public.
Many doctors, nurses and other medical staff have lost their lives while treating the patients. Here is a war-like situation. They are also scared about the possibility that they carry the killer virus home and spread it to the family.
Alongside comes the people’s irresponsible behavior, couldn’t-care-less attitude, the mass gatherings, political rallies, cinema craze, all helping spread the deadly virus. All these are happening when the frontline Covid warriors are staking their lives and attending to patients non-stop and gasping for breath.
 
Dr Anita Rego, mental health professional and psychotherapist, said: “As frontline workers they deal with the real miseries of the patients, those who are struggling on their beds, those who are breathing their last. The stories of medical success are often clouded by these realities. We need to build an envelope of caring professionals and psychotherapists on whom they can fall back and build their strength and energy.”
She added: “Providing healthcare workers with stronger networks of specialist mental health services is not yet a priority with our health system and we need to advocate it.”
 
Dr Daljeet Kaur, consultant psychiatrist, said: “There will be frustration, stress and anxiety. The medical staff is disheartened because the situation is not in their control. When it comes to the doctors’ level, the coronavirus variants are unpredictable and it is difficult for them to understand the prognosis of patients.”
“The stress level, though, varies between individual and individual. While a senior doctor might be stressed and overwhelmed, a nursing staff or paramedic on the frontline and spending more time with the patient is more depressed seeing the conditions from close quarters.”
 
She suggested: “Counselors should be allocated for patients and the attenders. This will reduce the load of the consulting doctors. The medical staff should also be counseled on a periodical basis. Mental health of the medical staff should be a priority.”

Dr J Shivkumar, senior cardiologist: “The medical professionals are always under stress due to various reasons. Now, in the Covid situation, they are putting their lives on stake and saving the patient, whereas the general public is game with flaunting all the Covid protocols, further straining the health sector facilities.”
 
Dr Ashish Chauhan, Covid care expert at Apollo Hospital: “With an exposure some 100 to 1,000 times more that of the general public, the health care professionals are dead scared while performing their duties. Currently they are working like a soldier, ready to be martyred during a war. A sincere thanks by the patients and their relatives is what they expect.” 
“As per an IMA study, an average Indian doctor lives 10 years lesser than the normal population. Now, some 70 to 80 per cent of the patients are treated and they walkout healthy whereas some 20 to 30 per cent die. This is not an easy sight to digest.”
 
Dr  Karuna Madap, paediatrician, Covid-care: “Health care warriors should protect themselves and their families first. If they are physically and mentally strong, they can take care of hundreds patients. The medical staff should constantly take proper counseling for their mental health from a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist. There should be some organisation to come forward and provide nutritious food for the medical staff.”
Dr Sahithi Reddy Lebaka, junior doctor at Fever Hospital, Nallakunta: “Wearing plastic PPE kits for hours in his summer is not an easy task. Restless extra shifts due to constant patient flow, insufficient medical supplies and instruments, all these mean for us a mental fatigue.”
 
Dr M A Faroqui, professor, PG department of Unani medicine, Tibbi College, Charminar: “On Wednesday, two doctors in this Unani hospital have perished due to Covid-19.

Laxman Rudavath, Telangana nursing officers association general secretary: “Nurses are the first to serve patients. Even in these deadly situations, we take care of patients to the best. As we see around too many deaths and when a lot of patients sufferings, we naturally get depressed. We also have a fear that we are taking home the virus to our family.”

Haseena Begum, Ayah, Nelofer Hospital: “Seeing the sufferings of patients, especially little children who are infected by coronavirus, makes us more sad and these days we don’t even feel like eating. We all are so scared!”

"New Delhi: Romanian writer-director Radu Jude’s Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn opens with a naughty, kinky pornographic scene. Emi (Katia Pascariu), a school teacher, is having sex with her husband and they are recording the proceedings for a bit of extra thrill.
But somehow the sex tape leaks and is soon making the rounds of giggly WhatsApp groups of her students and their parents. Some download it, purportedly as evidence to beat Emi with. The fact that the sex is consensual, between a husband and wife is irrelevant. There is outrage, and it's mostly about how could a middle-aged, married woman be so raunchy.
 
Radu Jude’s film, which uses this porn clip and the subsequent ""trial"" of Emi in the school’s yard to draw circles around a society's hypocrisy, won the Golden Bear award for Best Film at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Friday.
The film is split in three parts. In the first, Loony Porn walks with Emi as she visits her school principal, goes to a book store and a pharmacy. Shot during the Coronavirus pandemic, this segment has visuals of a city all masked up and wary of social interactions. But it's also a city busy consuming, enraging, eradicating the past.
 
We watch arguments and fights in a supermarket, with owners of big cars who block the sidewalk as a matter of their right. Each clash is an assertion of the entitlement of the rich and marginalisation of others.
The film’s second part is polyphonic and here, through commentary, archival footage, statistics, words, nudes in newspapers, building rising and in ruins, Loony Porn tells the story of Romania — about its role in the Holocaust, its attitude to Jews, Romas, love for dictators, attitude to sex and children. It also tells us that in Romania, 6 out of 10 kids are subjected to family violence.
 
This fact hovers over the film's last segment -- the meeting called by the school principal and parents to interrogate and then vote on Emi’s future. It is kicked off by a parent who insists on playing the sex clip for the benefit of all those gathered.
This scene, framed like an inquisition — the ""accused"" is in the middle, flanked by a judge who will rule based on the mood of the people and the enforcer of morality — is both dark and funny. Though allegations, tangential discussions, innuendoes, inappropriate remarks, shrill sanctimony and, finally, the judgment, Loony Porn lays bare a nation that has revised its history to legitimise its past and current criminal acts and feels emboldened to air its prejudice, bigotry and misplaced rage. Because many speak in the same tongue, collective hypocrisy gets elevated to a sanctimonious, narcissistic chorus.  
 
What's striking is how familiar it all feels. This searing portrait of a nation and its people could well be a day in the life of India.

"The women of today are focused, feisty and raring to go in pursuit of their true calling. And nothing seems to be holding them back. Because she knows exactly what she wants and is growing increasingly immune to petty criticism and stereotypical judgements.
In a fun chat, a bunch of women speak about the inanest comments that came their way when they chose to follow their heart. And what needs to change, as we celebrate another year of Women’s Day!
 
Don’t need sympathy
I am not a propagator of pushing or breaking the glass ceiling. We harp on and on about the fictional glass ceiling. In my opinion, we create our own reality by owning up to our actions. What glass ceiling are we talking about? It has always been a self-fulfilling prophecy. On one hand, we’re always talking about equality and on the other we expect praise for being a woman entrepreneur. Just like you have ‘a boss’ — not a woman boss or a male boss — you’re an entrepreneur, irrespective of gender. The term ‘woman entrepreneur’ is redundant. Your goals don’t know or care about your gender. Just keep going and rise through to where you ought to be.”
Ami Sata, Founder, Amouve
 
Be happy
One should follow their own soul’s calling. I’ve been told I was a dreamer, crazy, irresponsible and ungrounded just because I chose to do what made me happy. Women are questioned a lot more about their choices, and I really hope that changes. Most women today in my opinion are looking for freedom — and being able to do what you like is true freedom.”
Sheelaa Bajaj, Celebrity numerologist
No room for regression
A male acquaintance once said to me, out of the blue, ‘Honestly, Sanhita, I think you are trying too hard. You could have just put on some make-up, and dressed well and got married to a rich guy so that you don’t have to do anything and enjoy a luxurious life’.
I’ve often been asked when is my Chick Lit book coming out. This women’s day I wish we are inclusive of all genders when we make decisions. But above all, I wish that we are able to create a safe society which is more accepting of all kinds of people so that in the future we no longer need to celebrate a certain day to remind people of what more needs to be done to benefit us all.”
Sanhita Baruah,best-selling author of The Art of Letting Go in Amazon’s poetry category, 2020
 
Take charge of your life
I have heard many comments like ‘That’s interesting! What else do you do?’ Another regular comment is, ‘You must not be married. That’s why you are able to do all this. See how things change after marriage...’.
Truth is I’ve been married for 10 years now. My wish for every woman is to be able to take charge of their lives and be aware of their own capabilities, irrespective of people’s perceptions about them or what they do.”
Shambhavi Singh, (Runs Kaushalya.mantra, a wellness start-up, focuses on holistic health)
 
Freedom from bias
It’s high time people start to take fledgling women entrepreneurs seriously. I was once told that I could enjoy and have fun in life on the pretext of ‘entrepreneurship.’ These were their exact words, ‘No one will even question you. But if you are really serious, then let me tell you, building a sustainable business is not everyone’s cup of tea.’
So, from my experience, when women talk about wanting and finding freedom, it actually starts with the need for freedom against bias and stereotyping.”

The fact that the sex is consensual, between a husband and wife is irrelevant. There is outrage, and it's mostly about how could a middle-aged, married woman be so raunchy.
 
Radu Jude’s film, which uses this porn clip and the subsequent ""trial"" of Emi in the school’s yard to draw circles around a society's hypocrisy, won the Golden Bear award for Best Film at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Friday.
The film is split in three parts. In the first, Loony Porn walks with Emi as she visits her school principal, goes to a book store and a pharmacy. Shot during the Coronavirus pandemic, this segment has visuals of a city all masked up and wary of social interactions. But it's also a city busy consuming, enraging, eradicating the past.
 
We watch arguments and fights in a supermarket, with owners of big cars who block the sidewalk as a matter of their right. Each clash is an assertion of the entitlement of the rich and marginalisation of others.
The film’s second part is polyphonic and here, through commentary, archival footage, statistics, words, nudes in newspapers, building rising and in ruins, Loony Porn tells the story of Romania — about its role in the Holocaust, its attitude to Jews, Romas, love for dictators, attitude to sex and children. It also tells us that in Romania, 6 out of 10 kids are subjected to family violence.
 
This fact hovers over the film's last segment -- the meeting called by the school principal and parents to interrogate and then vote on Emi’s future. It is kicked off by a parent who insists on playing the sex clip for the benefit of all those gathered.
This scene, framed like an inquisition — the ""accused"" is in the middle, flanked by a judge who will rule based on the mood of the people and the enforcer of morality — is both dark and funny. Though allegations, tangential discussions, innuendoes, inappropriate remarks, shrill sanctimony and, finally, the judgment, Loony Porn lays bare a nation that has revised its history to legitimise its past and current criminal acts and feels emboldened to air its prejudice, bigotry and misplaced rage. Because many speak in the same tongue, collective hypocrisy gets elevated to a sanctimonious, narcissistic chorus.  
 
What's striking is how familiar it all feels. This searing portrait of a nation and its people could well be a day in the life of India.

"Hyderabad: First there were the mice, and some rats. Then came Syrian hamsters and the rabbits. And finally there were the rhesus macaque monkeys. The lakhs of people receiving Covaxin to keep themselves safe from Covid-19, and to help stop the spread of the disease in India and elsewhere in the world, have much to thank these animals for.
Not just because these animals were the first ones to receive the jabs of the three vaccine candidates developed by scientists at the Bharat Biotech, along with Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).
 
Not just because the animals were deliberately injected with the SARS-CoV-2 to test the efficacy of the candidate vaccines while in their cages in a high security Level 4 biosafety hazard lab at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.
But because at the end of the study periods, each of them was put to sleep for ever before necropsies were performed on their bodies by the scientists who studied what the virus did to the animals and their organs, and how the vaccine candidates worked in controlling the virus in their bodies.
All these animals, unknown to anyone outside of the NIV lab or the scientists involved in the vaccine development — in human terms — made the ultimate sacrifice of giving up their lives so the very humans who put them through the trials, could keep themselves safe from the virus that probably racked their fragile bodies as the vaccines and the virus battled it out in their organs.
 
In three studies, scientists from Bharat Biotech, NIV and ICMR provide great detail about how the trial were conducted, and how the immune response for the candidate vaccines — three versions of the then under-development (during the peak of the lockdown in 2020) Bharat Biotech’s vaccine — was in these animals.
There is a reason why lab grown rats, mice, Syrian hamsters, and rabbits are chosen for the studies. As is also the case with the rhesus macaques. The manner in which the immune responses to a virus in these animals develop, is very close to how a human body responds to a virus. And therein lies the value of testing vaccine candidates on these animals even if it means injecting them with the virus to study how their bodies respond and how the vaccines work in controlling the virus in them.
 
Once the trial is over, even if it is possible to extract tissue samples from various organs without actually killing the animals, their subsequent upkeep and nursing them back to health is a hard task. Since these animals are bred for the express purpose of testing in labs, with the exception of the monkeys, and once the tests are completed they are of no further use for any other tests, they are put to sleep in the most humane way possible, according to a senior scientist well versed with the strict protocols that govern use of animals in labs for such tests.
 
While the rats, mice, rabbits and Syrian hamsters were lab-bred, the rhesus macaques that were used in testing Covaxin candidates were caught in the wild in Maharashtra.
According to the study on the tests conducted on the monkeys, permission from the Office of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Maharashtra state, was obtained for capturing 30 rhesus macaques from the wild. Because a decline in the macaque population was observed in the permitted areas of Maharashtra due to the habitat change “probably imposed by food scarcity during the Covid-19 lockdown period of India (March 25, 2020, till May 31, 2020),” 20 of them — 12 males and 8 females — “were captured using experienced monkey catchers,” the study reported. The research was conducted in compliance with the guidelines laid down by the Committee for the Purpose of Control And Supervision of Experiments on Animals, Government of India, the study said.

"The women of today are focused, feisty and raring to go in pursuit of their true calling. And nothing seems to be holding them back. Because she knows exactly what she wants and is growing increasingly immune to petty criticism and stereotypical judgements.
In a fun chat, a bunch of women speak about the inanest comments that came their way when they chose to follow their heart. And what needs to change, as we celebrate another year of Women’s Day!
 
Don’t need sympathy
I am not a propagator of pushing or breaking the glass ceiling. We harp on and on about the fictional glass ceiling. In my opinion, we create our own reality by owning up to our actions. What glass ceiling are we talking about? It has always been a self-fulfilling prophecy. On one hand, we’re always talking about equality and on the other we expect praise for being a woman entrepreneur. Just like you have ‘a boss’ — not a woman boss or a male boss — you’re an entrepreneur, irrespective of gender. The term ‘woman entrepreneur’ is redundant. Your goals don’t know or care about your gender. Just keep going and rise through to where you ought to be.”
Ami Sata, Founder, Amouve
 
Be happy
One should follow their own soul’s calling. I’ve been told I was a dreamer, crazy, irresponsible and ungrounded just because I chose to do what made me happy. Women are questioned a lot more about their choices, and I really hope that changes. Most women today in my opinion are looking for freedom — and being able to do what you like is true freedom.”
Sheelaa Bajaj, Celebrity numerologist
No room for regression
A male acquaintance once said to me, out of the blue, ‘Honestly, Sanhita, I think you are trying too hard. You could have just put on some make-up, and dressed well and got married to a rich guy so that you don’t have to do anything and enjoy a luxurious life’.
I’ve often been asked when is my Chick Lit book coming out. This women’s day I wish we are inclusive of all genders when we make decisions. But above all, I wish that we are able to create a safe society which is more accepting of all kinds of people so that in the future we no longer need to celebrate a certain day to remind people of what more needs to be done to benefit us all.”
Sanhita Baruah,best-selling author of The Art of Letting Go in Amazon’s poetry category, 2020
 
Take charge of your life
I have heard many comments like ‘That’s interesting! What else do you do?’ Another regular comment is, ‘You must not be married. That’s why you are able to do all this. See how things change after marriage...’.
Truth is I’ve been married for 10 years now. My wish for every woman is to be able to take charge of their lives and be aware of their own capabilities, irrespective of people’s perceptions about them or what they do.”
Shambhavi Singh, (Runs Kaushalya.mantra, a wellness start-up, focuses on holistic health)
 
Freedom from bias
It’s high time people start to take fledgling women entrepreneurs seriously. I was once told that I could enjoy and have fun in life on the pretext of ‘entrepreneurship.’ These were their exact words, ‘No one will even question you. But if you are really serious, then let me tell you, building a sustainable business is not everyone’s cup of tea.’
So, from my experience, when women talk about wanting and finding freedom, it actually starts with the need for freedom against bias and stereotyping.”

"New Delhi: Evil is beguiling, evil geniuses more so. They excite us like tantalising puzzles that we want to examine and solve.  
Writers, film directors, theatre owners and audiences are almost like law enforcement officers in their pursuit to understand psychopaths and that’s why they keep revisiting terrorists, serial killers, rapists -- for yet another peek into their minds, their homes, their rage, and their crimes.
 
But, psychopaths are also cliches.
Almost every exploration of a criminal mind that's been mounted on the big screen or split into episodes for OTT platforms is a trek down a familiar road. En route there are absentee or overbearing parents. Some physical or emotional abuse. There’s unease in mundane, social situations. Solace in solitude. And there’s almost, always, sexual frustration.
Given this template, there is nothing exceptional in the story of Theodore Kaczynski, or as he is better known, Ted Kaczynski, America’s Unabomber. And yet, writer-director Tony Stone’s film Ted K, which had its world premiere at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Monday, stands out.
 
To tell the story of the Unabomber, Stone uses real television clips, Kaczynski’s writings, diary entries — which were copious and in numerical code — and meshes them with an intense, bravura performance by Sharlto Copley.
The South African actor, known for his performance as Wikus van der Merwe in the 2009 science fiction film District 9, carries Ted K with a meticulously studied but intense act that is as discomforting as it is impressive.
He remains in an unrelenting wired state throughout, whether he is raging against the whirring helicopters overhead, the pillage of the earth around him, building a bomb or complaining to a telephone company official about the $5 and few cents that a public phone owes him.
 
We watch, in his body and face, as his complexes, sense of superiority, frustration turn into a raging, mad desire to seek revenge on corporates, technology, one parcel bomb at a time.
Great performances, especially in biopics, are marked by that moment when the actor becomes the character, embodying and portraying all the ugliness and physicality while creating an inner cosmos that we can read in their eyes, in the tiniest change of expression.
Copley as Kaczynski, a mathematics prodigy who joined Harvard University at the age of 16 but then checked out to live by himself in Montana mountains in a 10-by-12 wood cabin, is on the screen throughout. Except for a few brief scenes in the 120-minute film, the camera stays on Copley and there is not a single false note in his compelling act.
 
Among the younger lot in Hollywood, Christian Bale, Leonado de Caprio, Matthew McConaughey, Javier Bardem, Joaquin Phoenix, James Franco and Bradley Cooper are names taken with reverence in terms of how much they give of themselves to a role.
Difficult films with demanding roles can ride on them.
To that hall of fame, Ted K adds the name of Sharlto Copley. He creates the sort of scary, uneasy portrait of a man in constant distress and rage that won’t ever leave you.

"Hyderabad: In the rapidly evolving field of healthcare protocols and advancements in treatments of various diseases and health conditions, two city doctors have been digging deep, down to the genetic information level, in a bid to ensure best possible outcomes for their patients.
“This is the next step in medical care,” says Dr Kalyan Uppuluri, from K&H Personalized Medicine Clinic. He, along with Dr Hima Challa, are the founders of the clinic, the first of its kind in the country to offer services bringing genomic medicine into clinical medicare. Armed with degrees in medical genomics from Stanford University and Harvard Medical School respectively, they say they took a leap of faith two years ago to set up their clinic in the city.
 
“There is enough data at the genetic level of humans to help modern medicine become more precise,” says Dr Hima Challa. “There is very strong objective evidence for this.”
The challenge for them was to translate molecular biology level data into medical language. A team of molecular biologists armed with advanced degrees dug deep into published research and after studying thousands of research papers, gathered data on around 8,000 genes and switched what each of them do and what that means in medical language. “For example, the gene that regulates glycogen provides information on how glucose is released when needed by the body. If there are disorders associated with this, this can be determined by genetic studies. If a person is prone to this problem, then advise can be given that he or she needs to consume carbohydrates before exercises or workouts so energy is available for these tasks,” Dr Hima Challa explained.
 
Genomic medicine helps in determining risk scores for various possible health conditions and these scores remain more or less stable through one’s life. Clinical risk scores can change, and can be changed for the better based on follow up advice from physicians, especially when coupled with knowledge of the genetic risk scores, she says.
“Our view is that personalized medicine is the future. Patients will be in a position, when their doctors have the assistance of genomic medicine, to be assured that they are in a position to achieve the best possible outcomes for their treatment,” says Dr Kalyan Uppuluri.
 
Medicines of the future will evolve based on genomics, he predicts. “We see this already in oncology, for treating cancers. Genomics is already helping in attacking this disease’s pathways,” he says.
On what the future holds, he says that they see their clinic offering their products based on algorithms developed based on genetic information they have complied as well as from their patients so far, to support clinics and hospitals. If clinical medicine is combined with genomic medicine and with proper follow-ups by patients, the treatment outcomes will be much better, help patients overcome their disease and help their doctors prescribe protocols that can better combat their conditions, he says.

"Hyderabad: A recently launched biography of the late N.T. Rama Rao, titled 'Maverick Messaiah', written by journalist Ramesh Kandula, chronicles and analyses the political life of NTR and its impact on both the state and the nation. An objective assessment of the late leader, the book has been well-received for its critical insight and diligent research.
What set NTR apart from later day movie stars entering politics? Is the Telugu Desam a Kamma party meant to empower the community and is it dying? In this two-part interview with Sriram Karri, author Kandula defends the party and explains what set NTR apart.
 
Why did NTR remain the last real actor phenomenon to achieve political success? Tamil superstar Rajanikant has now announced he won’t enter politics, while Chiranjeevi and Pawan Kalyan had great fan networks but could not convert them into political parties that could debut with electoral wins.
Film actors who entered politics in the past, especially M.G. Ramachandran (MGR) and later on, N.T. Rama Rao (NTR), had a strong artistic urge to connect with the people. The social bonding they enjoyed with their audiences was qualitatively different from actors who strayed into politics in recent years. Despite enormous adulation they enjoyed, neither MGR nor NTR took the people for granted when entering politics. Unlike MGR, NTR did not have a political pedigree, but spared no effort in understanding and articulating public issues that impacted the masses.
 
Chiranjeevi enjoyed many advantages but failed to convince the voting public that he was an alternative to the existing set-up. His campaign began with an assumption that he was a chief-minister-in-waiting and he had to just walk through elections to occupy the chair.
While NTR used his celluloid image to reach out to the public, he never relied on his glamour alone. The political content of NTR’s campaign was more focused and serious, while Chiranjeevi’s was more style than substance. I think Pawan Kalyan also suffers from the same failings (as his brother). Actors cannot succeed in politics unless they carry a serious political message.
 
Did the kind of films NTR played, particularly mythologies, give him any advantage? Why did he have such high credibility with masses? What in your estimate justifies calling him a messiah of any kind, even if of a maverick kind?
An interesting aspect of NTR's mythologies were that they were pan-Indian stories, and not directly related to Telugu nationalism and pride that NTR propounded politically. During NTR’s time, screen adaptations of mythologies became known for a distinctive Telugu, which was formal and ceremonial. As several researchers have pointed out, NTR's mastery over language, considered a quintessential Telugu experience, did help in his emergence as a Telugu cultural symbol.
 
My hypothesis is that NTR carried over the linguistic identity of these films into his political campaign, but not his screen 'divinity'. His political credibility was not a by-product of his playing godly characters. He worked towards it consciously both in his film career and later on in politics.
As for the tag of messiah, NTR burst on to the political scene in 1982 as a ray of hope and captivated the imagination of the Telugus like no other leader. His campaigns were the greatest spectacles of democracy in action. Shortcomings notwithstanding, NTR emerged as a larger-than-life personality and brought a sea-change in the socio-political landscape of AP.
 
The maverick apart, NTR was a man of strange contradictions. He believed in the power of people, but his democratic credentials were suspect because he had no qualms in turning his party into a one-man show. He was secular to the core but exhibited a peculiar religious streak. He entered politics on the plank of regionalism but remained a committed nationalist throughout.
How did people relate to his dramatics and eccentricities?
His dramatics entertained the masses but some sections of people intensely disliked the theatrics he brought into politics. He carried this urge to be the centre of attraction from reel to public life. However, common folks were not particularly put off by this, because of his ability to convey seriousness of intent. Despite the nickname 'Drama Rao', NTR was a very serious man in private and rarely cracked a joke. But a common person felt warmth in his presence.

"When actor and director Olivia Wilde, best known for her role in the TV series House, was snapped holding hands with singer Harry Styles, who is 10 years her junior, one fan tweeted, “If she has kids at home, but is out running around with a dude a decade younger during a pandemic, she belongs to the streets (sic).”
Such vitriol against the mother, who found a date during the pandemic! Another user on the microblogging site wrote, “should be taking care of her two kids instead of dating one (sic)”.
Apparently, women are all on notice — if you give birth to a child and are single, you must say goodbye to your physical needs. What’s worse, the keep-it-in-your-pants attitude has existed across all strata of society—celebs, women from emancipated homes, and you-name-it.
Pooja Srinivasaraja, director of a global food chain, points out how women are expected to adhere to many rules that somehow seem to place them in a moral compass. “Being pious and not expressing passion post a child is so culturally engrained in us. If a mother was to be single, her looking for love or a companion is almost scorned upon,” she spells out.
The double standards
However, unlike Olivia Wilde, who had to endure unsolicited moral instructions and condemnation from strangers on Twitter about her sexual affiliations, men are usually praised for their sexual desires. And that’s what advocate Malini says is the flaw in our thinking. “If men stray even while in a marriage, the world attributes it to his success, stress and even an incompatible wife. His friends too look up to him as being a talent of sorts. But when a woman who is separated but has kids even dares to look for love, not necessarily marriage, even her own pals can be judgmental,” she states.
As early as 1975, when Australian activist Anne Summers did a seminal feminism-oriented book, titled Damned Whores and God’s Police, it became an unexpected bestseller, selling more than 100,000 copies. The book makes an observation that the absence of a culture embracing women as being anything other than either devoted mothers or “bad girls” was the “major impediment to female rebellion, and that which keeps women physically and psychologically bound to their family-centered roles”.
Sexual suppositions
Even as recently as five years ago, reality star Kim Kardashian, mother to four children, was unscrupulously attacked for appearing nude on the cover of Paper magazine. “I normally don’t. But … you’re someone’s mother,” wrote the late actress Naya Rivera who died by drowning in July 2020. However, and perhaps thankfully, that remark found its share of critics too. For one, Rachel Khona, of the popular parenting blog Scary Mommy and writer for several publications including The New York Times, The Washington Post, Playboy, Penthouse, Maxim, and Cosmopolitan, hit back. “Are moms supposed to suddenly metamorphosis after they have a child? We should respect women’s sexuality the same way we do men’s,” she wrote.
Even US-based transgender icon Laverne Cox agrees that society can be rather judgmental towards women. “When a woman dates younger men, and especially if you’re a mother they’d say, ‘Maybe you should be spending some time with your children.’ Why can’t a single mum leave her kids to the father to attend to while she also looks to satiate her needs?” she points out.
Your passion, your choice
Professor Dr Saranya Jai, a specialist in gender and sexual studies, isn’t surprised that mothers are still facing this censorship and prejudice. “These conversations about sexuality and consent are essential and important, and the ability for women to be able to choose to do what they want with their own body, and have sexual lives that are not only to reproduce,” adds Dr Saranya.
“Just as racism exists, sexism will exist. We need more women to find their voices and be bold about their choices. Conviction and courage will do the trick. We needn’t be apologetic about wanting to lead fulfilling lives. Kids or otherwise, we have a right to our own happiness.”

"Hyderabad: The past few weeks saw various rare astronomical events, the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction, the triple conjunction of Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn, the Moon passing Mars- but astronomy enthusiasts in the city say that it is no more a thrill to witness these space events, because of the city lights.
Light pollution is a menace in the city of Hyderabad which is killing the joy of looking up to the night sky, astronomy enthusiasts and scientists have complained. Praveen Suryavanshi, an amateur astronomer and educator said that just to witness a full dark sky, one now will have to travel as far as at least a 100 kms away from the city. 
 
""I and my friends from the astronomers society in the city witnessed the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction from our offices and homes respectively. I was in Hi-Tech city that day, and in the shots I managed to get from the event show the kind of pollution from city lights and even the dust that emcompasses the sky now"", said Praveen. He added that the big flood lights, the neon lights on billboards and malls till the Shamshabad area have added to the mess, especially in the last four to five years. ""These unnecessary lights and the continuous construction activities have spoiled the city skies so much that even the night sky reflects this light, and on most nights clouds are visible"", he said.  
 
Dr. BG Sidharth, Director of the Birla Planetarium said that the first observatory near the city at Rangapur, 65 kms from the city, has also been affected by the light pollution. ""Unless one is very far away, on a hill or mountain, practicing astronomy in today's time is difficult, which is why the astronomy community here is growing weaker"", he said. 
The Japal-Rangapur Observatory under Osmania University open for research and practical work for post-graduate and Ph.D students, as well as for the public, has had the effects of civilisation in the nearby villages, but still has its nights of clear skies, argued Dr. Shanti Priya, Head, Department of Astronomy, OU. However, she agreed that the kind of dark sky experience a few years ago, is something that this generation will never be able to get. 
 
""We have held observation classes in the past few weeks for the conjunction occurrences among other events, for our 40-50 PG and research students. The LED lights around have had an effect on the observatory, but if the government takes some measures to increase the scientific temper while keeping in view the convenience of people around, like installing LED light covers, it will solve the issue to a great extent"", said Dr. Shanti Priya.
According to the world light pollution map, the location of the Rangapur Observatory falls in a rural/suburban transition sky, where the galaxy M33 in Triangulum, a key indicator of sky conditions visible to the eye is difficult to see. Here in the city, the location of the Birla Science Center Observatory is one of the highest light polluted areas anywhere in the world, making it impossible to locate the M33 galaxy in the city sky. 
 
Astronomers in the city now demand that government must take steps to protect the few dark skies left in and around the city like the Kotpally Reservoir area near Ananthagiri Hills, the Pocharam Dam in Medak, the Pakhal lake near Warangal, the Laknavaram Lake area, among others, by making strict policies to restrict urbanisation and declare these spots as Natural Dark Sky Sites.
Amateur astronomers have also brought to light an Archeoastronomy Megalithic site, similar to the Stonehenge 200 kms from Hyderabad, which falls under the village of Mudumal in Mahabubnagar district, where dark skies can be witnessed clearly. They demand that these sites should be preserved and protected for astronomy enthusiasts.

"When actor and director Olivia Wilde, best known for her role in the TV series House, was snapped holding hands with singer Harry Styles, who is 10 years her junior, one fan tweeted, “If she has kids at home, but is out running around with a dude a decade younger during a pandemic, she belongs to the streets (sic).”
Such vitriol against the mother, who found a date during the pandemic! Another user on the microblogging site wrote, “should be taking care of her two kids instead of dating one (sic)”.
Apparently, women are all on notice — if you give birth to a child and are single, you must say goodbye to your physical needs. What’s worse, the keep-it-in-your-pants attitude has existed across all strata of society—celebs, women from emancipated homes, and you-name-it.
Pooja Srinivasaraja, director of a global food chain, points out how women are expected to adhere to many rules that somehow seem to place them in a moral compass. “Being pious and not expressing passion post a child is so culturally engrained in us. If a mother was to be single, her looking for love or a companion is almost scorned upon,” she spells out.

"WASHINGTON: @realDonaldTrump, the Twitter feed that grew from the random musings of a reality TV star into the cudgel of an American president, has died. It was not quite 12 years old.
The provocative handle was given birth by a New York real estate tycoon who used it to help him become the 45th U.S. president. It began with a May 4, 2009, tweet promoting Donald Trump’s upcoming appearance on David Letterman’s show.
 
It died more than 57,000 tweets later, with Trump using some of his final postings on the powerful platform to commiserate with a pro-Trump mob that besieged the halls of Congress in a deadly assault as lawmakers were set to certify his defeat.
The account met its demise when Twitter announced Friday it was pulling the plug permanently on @realDonaldTrump, citing concern that Trump would use it for “further incitement of violence.” Trump retorted that he’d be “building out our own platform in the near future. We will not be SILENCED!”
 
Trump, a novice politician but seasoned salesman, realized the power of social media in ways that few other politicians did. And he wielded it with never-before-seen power to diminish his opponents, shape elections and mold reality — at least in the eyes of his supporters.
Early on, @realDonaldTrump seemed innocent enough. Its owner, who had prolific experience in marketing casinos, real estate and even Oreos, used the platform mostly to promote his books, media appearances and give friendly plugs to friends.
But as Trump began seriously toying with a White House run, it became a tool to scorch opponents and give shape to his nationalist, “America First” philosophy.
 
He deployed its venom equally, whether insulting celebrity enemies (Rosie O’Donnell was “crude, rude, obnoxious and dumb”) or or using xenophobia to malign a country (Britain is “trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem”).
Peter Costanzo, then an online marketing director for the publishing company putting out Trump’s book, “Think Like a Champion,” helped bring Trump to the platform.
Twitter was still in its infancy at the time. But Costanzo, who later came to work for The Associated Press, saw the then-140-character-per-message platform as a new tool that the real estate mogul could use to boost sales and reach a broader audience.
 
Costanzo was given seven minutes to make his pitch to Trump — “Not five minutes, not 10,” he recalled in a 2016 interview.
Trump liked what he heard.
“I said, ‘Let’s call you @realDonaldTrump — you’re the real Donald Trump,’” recalled Costanzo. “He thought about it for a minute and said: ‘I like it. Let’s do it.’”
Other than Trump’s family, no one seemed off-limits from his Twitter wrath. Trump attacked Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats, 2016 political rivals, current administration staffers, former administration staffers, the Republican Party and cable networks.
 
@realDonaldTrump was prolific: On days when its owner was particularly agitated, such as in the midst of impeachment proceedings, it pushed out more than 100 tweets.
In its most popular tweet, on Oct. 2, 2020, @realDonaldTrump announced that Trump and first lady Melania Trump had contracted the coronavirus. The post got 1.8 million likes and nearly 400,000 retweets, according to Factba.se., which tracks the president’s social media habits and commentary.
The account was used to announce firings. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson learned of his ouster in a tweet.
 
The account threatened adversaries in the most colorful terms. Before Trump “fell in love” with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un through secretly exchanged letters, Trump used Twitter to dub him “rocket man” and vowed to respond with “fire and fury” if the authoritarian dared attack the United States.
@realDonaldTrump frequently spread misleading, false and malicious assertions, such as the baseless ideas that protesters at Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings were paid by the liberal philanthropist George Soros and that November’s election was beset by voter fraud.
 
Trump often tweeted well past midnight and before dawn, a cathartic outlet for grievances (Witch hunt! Crooked Hillary, Russia, Russia, Russia, FAKE NEWS, and so on.) For the most part, @realDonaldTrump and its 280-character posts effectively allowed Trump to work around the Washington media establishment and amplify the message of allies.
Sometimes @realDonaldTrump stumbled. Trump deleted 1,166 tweets and, in his final months on the platform, had 471 tweets flagged by Twitter for misinformation, according to Factba.se.
In one of his most memorable Twitter stumbles, Trump in May 2017 sent (and later deleted) a cryptic post-midnight tweet that read “Despite the constant negative press covfefe.”
 
The gibberish set the Twitterverse afire with speculation. Theories included that the tweeter-in-chief had fallen asleep mid-message and that the man who once bragged of having “the best words” was adding a new word to the lexicon to properly describe collusion between Democrats and the press.
The mystery was never solved.
Sam Nunberg, a longtime — and now former — Trump adviser, said that in the summer of 2011, after Trump announced he wasn’t running in 2012 but wanted to remain relevant, his team decided to start using social media to boost his profile.
 
They chose to focus on Twitter, where he already had an account and several hundred thousand followers. Nunberg remembers sending Trump daily reports on his follower growth. Trump would sometimes hand it back with hand-written notes — “Why not more?” “Why so slow?”
They celebrated when they hit the million mark.
“Twitter definitely played a pivotal role in building Donald Trump as a political figure within Republican politics and he also greatly enjoyed it,” said Nunberg. “Remember he used to say: ‘I wanted to own a newspaper. This is great, it’s like a newspaper without the losses.’”
 
Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took to Twitter shortly after the platform banned @realDonaldTrump to note that it continues to allow Iran’s supreme leader “and numerous other dictatorial regimes” to use the platform, but cannot abide his father.
“Mao would be proud,” Trump Jr. scoffed.
In the end, @realDonaldTrump offered an in-the-moment peek into Trump’s state of mind over more than a decade, a period in which the “Apprentice” TV star transformed into the 45th American president.
 
Down the road, when historians look for a glimpse into Trump thoughts on the issues of his time -- anything from actress Kristen Stewart’s treatment of co-star Robert Pattinson to the president’s views on Russian meddling in the 2016 election — the first stop may inevitably be one of the many digital archives that have preserved the tweets of @realDonaldTrump.
With Trump, whatever the topic, there’s always a tweet for that.

"Pharma companies are madly competing with each other when it comes to finding the first effective vaccine against COVID-19. Because of its topical importance, this race is not just between corporate companies alone. It has expanded to being a global competition between various countries (at both centre and state levels) invoking geo-politics. This tight race against time for finding a vaccine to inoculate the whole world is unprecedented in human history.
High Stakes Involved
 
The sheer volume of expected sales for such a vaccine at the moment is breathtaking. It’s a big money game running into billions of dollars. Hence it is not a surprise that many companies want to win this jackpot. “COVID vaccine is going to be a life saving drug and its sales plus distribution should be considered from a humanitarian point of view. It should not be used as a tool for making exorbitant profits by companies to exploit the poor and needy,” explains K.K. Shailaja Teacher, Minister of Health and Social Welfare for Kerala.
 
“All nations need to be given licenses and granted equal opportunity in the production of these life saving vaccines. International agencies like the UN and International Court of Justice should consider intervening, if necessary, to give a level playing field for all countries on this global public health matter,” adds Shailaja, who has become a global female icon and role model in the fight against COVID.
Vaccine Stockpiling 
Rich and prosperous countries are giving advance orders to stockpile hundreds of millions of doses in advance. Poorer countries are unable to match on this hoarding race because of the astronomical costs involved.
 
Sudden stockpiling at present market prices by richer countries could ensure prices for vaccines not to drop in near future. This in turn would not make life easier for poorer countries. This pandemic and global vaccination drive is going to bring in a multi-faceted economics problem as well.
Who Pays for Vaccines: Government or People?
In health insurance driven countries, it is still unclear whether insurance companies would take care of the costs or whether their citizens will have to pay an additional premium for getting vaccinated. In European countries, there is no full clarity as to whether the state would bear all the costs for vaccinating the entire population. In African countries, it is not clear whether other richer countries or international organisations would step-in to help them.
 
Due to the severity of the circumstances, companies are requesting the FDA for an early deployment of vaccines even before the clinical trials end. The scientific data provided by these companies thus far show that their respective vaccines are indeed effective. However, the current clinical trials being carried out are not double blind, and therefore there is an ethical responsibility to let the volunteer know whether they are in the placebo group or not, once the study becomes unblind.

India’s High Population and Centre/State Cooperation
In highly populated countries like India, it is going to be a huge budgetary challenge to inoculate more than a billion people. It is still not clear how the centre and state are going to share these huge costs. Generous donations from philanthropists might only cover some tens of millions of doses inside India which is still a small fraction of our population.
 
In limited budgetary constraints, how to pick and choose the subjects for free inoculation is another tricky subject. Besides all this, even political parties are trying to score brownie points as to where and when free vaccines will be given. It is not yet clear whether only the healthcare workers will be vaccinated or whether the whole general population will be included for free inoculation.
Vaccine Administering Challenges
In addition to direct costs of vaccines, there will be added logistical costs regarding its transportation, storage, administering etc. Vaccinating the whole of India uniformly in a short span of time is going to be a logistical nightmare.
 
Some states have higher budgets than others. Some states have more robust health care systems than others. Besides budget, the most crucial point is the cold chain challenge — i.e. retaining the efficacy of vaccines from point of manufacture to point of administering. Feasible cold chain management plays a key role in selecting one vaccine over a list of other available vaccines. Massive transportation and storage at a permissible range of deep freezing temperatures is a massive challenge in countries like India.
“While vaccine availability will be one end-point, we should remember that distributing vaccines will take time and that we will need to maintain restrictions around physical distancing and masks for a good while to come,” advises Prof Gautam Menon, infectious diseases modelling expert at Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.
 
Why Developing Vaccines Take Time?
 
Vaccine candidates are first tested in animal models (pre-clinical validation). Only the most promising will be carried on in a clinical trial. This trial proceeds step by step, involving an increasing number of human subjects.
“It begins with a small group of healthy volunteers (phase I). If the response to the vaccine is good (no severe side effect but a good immune response), the number will scale up involving hundreds (phase II) and later thousands of volunteers (phase III). It is a blind placebo-control trial: part of the volunteers receives the vaccine, the remaining receive a placebo but they don’t know in which group they are. The volunteers for phase III should be chosen in countries in which the virus is actively circulating because, to calculate the efficacy of the vaccine, you need to compare the number of infections in the vaccine group with the one in the placebo group. This is the stage in which the most advanced COVID-19 vaccines are,” explains Dr Giuditta De Lorenzo, a virologist at MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, UK.
 
At the end of the clinical trial, all the collected data are reviewed by the regulatory agency (i.e FDA or EMA). Only when the agency gives the final approval, the vaccine is considered safe enough to be introduced in the population as part of the vaccination programmes.
“Usually, all together, this takes several years but the speed of the COVID-19 vaccines development has been impressive. Never in history a vaccine reached phase III in such a short amount of time. That was possible because of new technologies available but mostly because the urgency of the situation justified a huge investment of money, a simplification of bureaucracy and the redirection of many resources to this project (putting on hiatus many other research projects). But as efficient as the system can be, there is still a physiological time that needs to be respected: to mount an immune response after the vaccine, to spot any possible side effects and, for the volunteers, to encounter the virus and confirm their protection.” adds Dr De Lorenzo, who works on latest viral research.
 
Fast Tracking — Pros and Cons
When this process is being fast tracked in the present circumstance, it will help to instill more confidence and less fear in the minds of the general public and COVID victims. However fast tracking this comes with its fair share of cons too. “Due to the severity of the circumstances, companies are requesting the FDA for an early deployment of vaccines even before the clinical trials end. The scientific data provided by these companies thus far show that their respective vaccines are indeed effective, and an early release absolutely makes sense. However, such an ‘emergency use’ approval will certainly compromise the ongoing clinical trials not only of these vaccines, but also for those which have just started. The current clinical trials being carried out are not double blind, and therefore there is an ethical responsibility to let the volunteer know whether they are in the placebo group or not, once the study becomes unblind.” elaborates Dr Sreejith Rajasekharan, a virologist at Laboratory of Molecular Virology, International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Italy.
 
None can be directly blamed in this context because the demand and pressure are unprecedented from various interest groups. “As soon as the vaccine will be made available, these volunteers have the right to take the vaccine, and therefore can no longer be included in the control group. If too many volunteers cross over, the study might not have sufficiently large control groups to obtain statistically significant results for certain long-term goals,” adds Dr Rajasekharan, virologist who was part of the team that sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome in early March 2020.

"As the first Indian female newsreader and radio jockey, Saeeda Bano left behind a pioneering legacy. Shahana Raza, her granddaughter who translated her memoir, Off the Beaten Track, remembers her as an emotionally resilient person in a chat with Sucheta Dasgupta
Aside from being an Indian radio pioneer, who broke bread with India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, your grandmother was one of India’s first independent Muslim women. Not only was she living by herself in the 1940s, in the 1930s, she drove a car unchaperoned. This is a freedom not available to most Indian women, Hindu or Muslim, even today. Did Saeeda Bano consider herself a feminist?
 
Did Saeeda Bano consider herself a feminist? I don’t know that for sure, but she most definitely knew she was ahead of her times, that the life she led was Dagar se Hatt kar, off the beaten track, which is why she used it as the title of her autobiography.
Your grandmother was more sporting than studious. She was not, in that sense, the typical intellectual feminist. Would you consider her a rebel in her household? How well was she loved by her family?
Relatively speaking, compared with her older siblings, Saeeda Bano was definitely the rebel in her family. The fact that she was allowed to be herself, especially by her father, went a long way in filling her with confidence and also proves they loved her for who she was.
 
In the book, she refers to herself as a girl with “a strange blend of complicated traits in her personality'. Yes, she was more sporting than studious, but she also read voraciously. After marriage she receives both love and importance from her husband’s family as well, especially from her father-in-law Justice Mohammed Raza.
What, to your mind, did she have to give up in order to lead the life that she did and accomplish what she did?
In order to achieve what she did, Saeeda Bano had to, first and foremost, give up the emotional comfort and the financial security that comes with being part of a loving joint family. Embracing uncertainties, she forsook the familiarity and convenience of living in an easygoing city like Lucknow and went off to Delhi at the time of Partition in August 1947, tackling courageously the various challenges that came her way during this crucial time in history. To lead her life according to the dictates of her own conscience, she schooled her heart to face social disapproval.
 
One of the most charming episodes in the book is to do with Saeeda’s friendship with the singer and courtesan, Begum Akhtar. This friendship was forged despite the then prevailing custom of women observing purdah from courtesans. Surprisingly, her interactions with Akhtari met with little resistance at her in-laws’ and she managed to create from them a family tie. Was her husband’s family relatively liberal or was it due to her personal charisma that this became possible?
Bit of both, I would say. Initially, there was some feeble, lukewarm  resistance from her family. Ultimately she managed to persuade her husband Abbas Raza to visit Akhtari Bai’s kotha.
 
Was it Saeeda who broke the ice between lawyer Ishtiaq Abbasi’s acquaintances and Akhtari, thus clearing the path for their eventual marriage?
I don’t think Saeeda Bano had much to do with breaking the ice between Ishtiaq Abbasi’s acquaintances and Akhtari Bai. But after Akhtari approached my grandmother at the radio station and said, “Bittan, please get me married to Ishtiaq Abbasi sahab,” she took the bull by the horns. In her inimitably bold style, she called Ishtiaq bhai over for tea and candidly asked him to marry Akhtari! The rest, as they say, is history.
 
There is a documentary on Begum Akhtar called Hai Akhtari, on YouTube for which director Kalidas Swaminathan interviewed my grandmother. In that, you can hear Saeeda Bano narrate this entire incident in the most delightful manner, exactly as it is written up in this book.
While reading the book, I noticed that when Saeeda examines the relationship of her lover, three-time Delhi mayor Nuruddin Ahmed, with his English first wife, Billy, she concludes that it had faced challenges due to Billy’s not belonging to his own culture of compliant, coquettish or circumspect, women. But she herself was neither of those. Why this inconsistency?
 
Since I never had the opportunity to see my grandmother with Nuruddin Ahmed sahab, I can’t say what she was like with him as a woman. Perhaps she was coquettish and felt vulnerable around him. People do have various sides to their personality. How we interact with our children is not what we are like with our spouse or our parents. Even headstrong forthright women can be submissive when they choose to be!
What is your earliest memory of your grandmother?
My earliest memory of my grandmother is when we came from Lucknow to Delhi during our school vacations to visit her. We would meet up with our uncles, aunts and cousins and spend a lot of time eating all sorts of delicious foodstuff at India International Centre and go on these enjoyable family picnics to Lodhi Garden. She loved picnics! I also remember her cook Shakur Baba vividly.
 
What has been your own career trajectory? Why do you think she chose you to translate her book?
Over the years, I’ve had to transform myself professionally into several avatars. After starting out as a VT editor for programmes and documentaries, I moved to news editing, then reporting, before I finally settled down as video producer and freelance writer. 
Around the time she asked me to translate her book we had grown quite close, without really realising it. We had managed, by default, to forge a strong one-on-one bond and learnt to accept the not-so-palatable sides of our personalities as well. If she ticked me off, I couldn’t go running to any parent. I was living alone and working in Delhi. If I triggered her off, there was really no one she could complain to about my behaviour. With no other adult to help us navigate our relationship with one another, we grew closer.
 
What, according to you, is the strength of this book?
The appeal of the book, in my opinion lies in the brutal honesty with which she visits the past, confronts her own experiences and decides, even when she comes face to face with a painful raw emotion, that yes, I want to speak about this. She could have chosen to leave some hurtful incidents out of the book. But she doesn’t. As I mentioned in the translator’s note, Simone de Beauvoir said in Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter, “The writer is a traitor to his despair as soon as he writes a book.”

"Pharma companies are madly competing with each other when it comes to finding the first effective vaccine against COVID-19. Because of its topical importance, this race is not just between corporate companies alone. It has expanded to being a global competition between various countries (at both centre and state levels) invoking geo-politics. This tight race against time for finding a vaccine to inoculate the whole world is unprecedented in human history.
High Stakes Involved
 
The sheer volume of expected sales for such a vaccine at the moment is breathtaking. It’s a big money game running into billions of dollars. Hence it is not a surprise that many companies want to win this jackpot. “COVID vaccine is going to be a life saving drug and its sales plus distribution should be considered from a humanitarian point of view. It should not be used as a tool for making exorbitant profits by companies to exploit the poor and needy,” explains K.K. Shailaja Teacher, Minister of Health and Social Welfare for Kerala.
 
“All nations need to be given licenses and granted equal opportunity in the production of these life saving vaccines. International agencies like the UN and International Court of Justice should consider intervening, if necessary, to give a level playing field for all countries on this global public health matter,” adds Shailaja, who has become a global female icon and role model in the fight against COVID.
Vaccine Stockpiling 
Rich and prosperous countries are giving advance orders to stockpile hundreds of millions of doses in advance. Poorer countries are unable to match on this hoarding race because of the astronomical costs involved.
 
Sudden stockpiling at present market prices by richer countries could ensure prices for vaccines not to drop in near future. This in turn would not make life easier for poorer countries. This pandemic and global vaccination drive is going to bring in a multi-faceted economics problem as well.
Who Pays for Vaccines: Government or People?
In health insurance driven countries, it is still unclear whether insurance companies would take care of the costs or whether their citizens will have to pay an additional premium for getting vaccinated. In European countries, there is no full clarity as to whether the state would bear all the costs for vaccinating the entire population. In African countries, it is not clear whether other richer countries or international organisations would step-in to help them.
 
Due to the severity of the circumstances, companies are requesting the FDA for an early deployment of vaccines even before the clinical trials end. The scientific data provided by these companies thus far show that their respective vaccines are indeed effective. However, the current clinical trials being carried out are not double blind, and therefore there is an ethical responsibility to let the volunteer know whether they are in the placebo group or not, once the study becomes unblind.

India’s High Population and Centre/State Cooperation
In highly populated countries like India, it is going to be a huge budgetary challenge to inoculate more than a billion people. It is still not clear how the centre and state are going to share these huge costs. Generous donations from philanthropists might only cover some tens of millions of doses inside India which is still a small fraction of our population.
 
In limited budgetary constraints, how to pick and choose the subjects for free inoculation is another tricky subject. Besides all this, even political parties are trying to score brownie points as to where and when free vaccines will be given. It is not yet clear whether only the healthcare workers will be vaccinated or whether the whole general population will be included for free inoculation.
Vaccine Administering Challenges
In addition to direct costs of vaccines, there will be added logistical costs regarding its transportation, storage, administering etc. Vaccinating the whole of India uniformly in a short span of time is going to be a logistical nightmare.
 
Some states have higher budgets than others. Some states have more robust health care systems than others. Besides budget, the most crucial point is the cold chain challenge — i.e. retaining the efficacy of vaccines from point of manufacture to point of administering. Feasible cold chain management plays a key role in selecting one vaccine over a list of other available vaccines. Massive transportation and storage at a permissible range of deep freezing temperatures is a massive challenge in countries like India.

“Usually, all together, this takes several years but the speed of the COVID-19 vaccines development has been impressive. Never in history a vaccine reached phase III in such a short amount of time. That was possible because of new technologies available but mostly because the urgency of the situation justified a huge investment of money, a simplification of bureaucracy and the redirection of many resources to this project (putting on hiatus many other research projects). But as efficient as the system can be, there is still a physiological time that needs to be respected: to mount an immune response after the vaccine, to spot any possible side effects and, for the volunteers, to encounter the virus and confirm their protection.” adds Dr De Lorenzo, who works on latest viral research.

"Love him or hate him, no one can ignore President Donald Trump or his efforts to stay in the limelight. Weeks after the US election results announced 290 Electoral College votes for former Vice-President Joe Biden, Trump still refuses to concede defeat.
Even as Michelle Obama, wife of former US President Barack Obama, took to her Instagram to slam President Trump for impeding the democratic process, while stating that the presidency doesn’t belong to any one individual or party, President Trump has been behaving like a child unwilling to give up his toy despite the end of recess. ‘Hidden’ away in the White House, Trump continues to sulk, inaccurately claiming on Twitter voter fraud and faulty vote counting, falsely proclaiming victory in a race he lost.
 
The ludicrous conduct so unbecoming of a leader of the oldest democracy. But the indignity he presently showcases is merely one of the many etiquette gaffs Trump has displayed on the world stage, be it nationally or internationally. While on the national podium he mocks not only his opponents but also the differently abled, internationally, he makes blunders that may even appear intentional. During his 2017 tour to Japan, for instance, Trump criticised Japan’s inaction on not bombing North Korean missiles, stating not too subtly that modern Japan was weak. Then there was a lunch, where unlike his predecessor Obama who when visiting the Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe in 2014 had dined with him over sushi, Trump chose to eat burgers made with American meat… er… in the sushi capital of the world!
 
Few guidelines on etiquette
1 Practise civility, professionalism and decorum in public forums.
A public servant, an elected representative or even a very senior leader in a company should avoid making belligerent, personal, impertinent and slanderous comments. They must never threaten or abuse.
Example: Who better than Trump himself for an example? He constantly mocked Democratic Party’s presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren for claiming Native American ancestry (for which she apologised later), calling her ‘Pocahontas’. Many of his office bearers took it as a green signal to mock others, including Vice-President-Elect Kamala Harris, by calling her Kamalama, Kalamala, Camel Harris, etc.
 
2 Avoid personal comments | Remember that public personalities are always on display, and whether they like it or not, their actions, mannerism and language are constantly watched by people they may or may not know.
Example: In July this year, reporters claimed to have overheard US Congressman and Republican Ted Yoho, who’d accosted NY City Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), the youngest Democrat in the chamber, on the steps of the US Capitol in July this year, calling her ‘disgusting’, saying ‘you’re out of your freaking mind’, and then using an extreme swear word, calling the latter a ‘b**ch’. (Of course, AOC called out the behaviour in the House floor, to let him and others know that such a language was not acceptable.)
 
3 Honour dignity | As per Donna Hicks, PhD, and author of Leading with Dignity, leaders play a crucial role in creating a culture that brings out the best in people and must know how to honour the dignity of their people while creating policies that are sensitive to dignity issues. And to make dignity and dignity awareness a part of the workplace or social culture, the leader needs to model dignified behaviours. So if a president of a nation appears to not accept the verdict of its people nor honour the dignity of his position, the trickle-down effect could be a chaotic society refusing to accept rules and regulations laid down for it.

"It’s quite the no-brainer. The lexicographer’s choice of the year at first appearance was gratuitous, but on closer examination drove home the understanding that plague and Spanish flu notwithstanding, in terms of scope and impact, Covid-19 was the world’s first real “pandemic” which simultaneously gave us a taste of the awful homogeneity technology and globalisation has reduced us to, in a reckoning of sorts.
But that is what the word of the year, or woty, as it is acronymed, and pronounceably so, does; be it lived reality or a culture war, it captures the spirit of the times. For instance, last year’s winner was “they”, as used to describe a transgender person, someone who does not identify as male nor female, as compared with or, if you like, opposed to the (cis)gender-neutral pronoun in the singular number, itself interred in 2017 in the Chicago Manual of Style.
 
No doubt, though, “pandemic”, voted in by Merriem-Webster and Dictionary.com as Oxford indulged in some good old fence-sitting by picking not one or two but 16 appellations, had good competition. It mainly came from medical lingo like “asymptomatic”, “contact tracing”, “lockdown” and, of course, “quarantine”, as well as neologisms, often at once political and “viral”, such as “anti-masker”, “the Before Times”, “BLM”, “Antifa” and “Zoom fatigue”, also “Karen” denoting a middle-class white American woman prone to bullying black men in a convenient and self-serving interpretation of women’s rights. But good old “pandemic” — the word first was used in the mid-1600s in the sense of “universal” or “affecting everyone” and began appearing in medical texts concerning the plague soon after — won the vocabulary sweepstakes, “cancelling” them all.
 
Now all this hooha over una palabra might infuriate some of us who like to look down on intellectual gifts and make a song and dance about “deed over word”.

"Love him or hate him, no one can ignore President Donald Trump or his efforts to stay in the limelight. Weeks after the US election results announced 290 Electoral College votes for former Vice-President Joe Biden, Trump still refuses to concede defeat.
Even as Michelle Obama, wife of former US President Barack Obama, took to her Instagram to slam President Trump for impeding the democratic process, while stating that the presidency doesn’t belong to any one individual or party, President Trump has been behaving like a child unwilling to give up his toy despite the end of recess. ‘Hidden’ away in the White House, Trump continues to sulk, inaccurately claiming on Twitter voter fraud and faulty vote counting, falsely proclaiming victory in a race he lost.
 
The ludicrous conduct so unbecoming of a leader of the oldest democracy. But the indignity he presently showcases is merely one of the many etiquette gaffs Trump has displayed on the world stage, be it nationally or internationally. While on the national podium he mocks not only his opponents but also the differently abled, internationally, he makes blunders that may even appear intentional. During his 2017 tour to Japan, for instance, Trump criticised Japan’s inaction on not bombing North Korean missiles, stating not too subtly that modern Japan was weak. Then there was a lunch, where unlike his predecessor Obama who when visiting the Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe in 2014 had dined with him over sushi, Trump chose to eat burgers made with American meat… er… in the sushi capital of the world!
 
Few guidelines on etiquette
1 Practise civility, professionalism and decorum in public forums.
A public servant, an elected representative or even a very senior leader in a company should avoid making belligerent, personal, impertinent and slanderous comments. They must never threaten or abuse.
Example: Who better than Trump himself for an example? He constantly mocked Democratic Party’s presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren for claiming Native American ancestry (for which she apologised later), calling her ‘Pocahontas’. Many of his office bearers took it as a green signal to mock others, including Vice-President-Elect Kamala Harris, by calling her Kamalama, Kalamala, Camel Harris, etc.
 
2 Avoid personal comments | Remember that public personalities are always on display, and whether they like it or not, their actions, mannerism and language are constantly watched by people they may or may not know.
Example: In July this year, reporters claimed to have overheard US Congressman and Republican Ted Yoho, who’d accosted NY City Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), the youngest Democrat in the chamber, on the steps of the US Capitol in July this year, calling her ‘disgusting’, saying ‘you’re out of your freaking mind’, and then using an extreme swear word, calling the latter a ‘b**ch’. (Of course, AOC called out the behaviour in the House floor, to let him and others know that such a language was not acceptable.)
 
3 Honour dignity | As per Donna Hicks, PhD, and author of Leading with Dignity, leaders play a crucial role in creating a culture that brings out the best in people and must know how to honour the dignity of their people while creating policies that are sensitive to dignity issues. And to make dignity and dignity awareness a part of the workplace or social culture, the leader needs to model dignified behaviours. So if a president of a nation appears to not accept the verdict of its people nor honour the dignity of his position, the trickle-down effect could be a chaotic society refusing to accept rules and regulations laid down for it.

"A future world war might as well be started with a seed capital of $100,000 or less. That is the sobering reality of the Twitter security breach incident compromising a swathe of prominent people, from former US President Barack Obama to Elon Musk.
In a matter of hours, Twitter had shut down most of its verified Twitter handles and launched an active investigation into the breach.
 
A seed capital of $100,000 or less can be used to do widespread harm by hacking into social media sites that seem innocuous but are now vehicles of a new kind of warfare.
On April 23, 2013, the world saw what a Twitter hacking can do. The official Twitter handle of Associated Press tweeted a breaking story -- “Two explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured”. The tweet came at 1.07 pm and AP’s two million followers on Twitter started retweeting the issue in a matter of seconds.
In his book Future Crimes, author and former policeman Marc Goodman estimated that in just three minutes, that tweet had wiped out $136 billion from the stock markets.
 
A little-known hacking group, Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), admitted it had hacked into AP’s official Twitter handle. The SEA caused massive economic damage without even spending any major resources, and it did not even target a US official website or system.
Just the hack into the Twitter handle of a major private news organisation was enough to cause significant damage.
This is how social media has emerged as a tool of modern warfare, It is free to access, has vast reach, consumes very little resources, and makes the world a target. The current Twitter hacking raises two major obvious issues.
 
One, the social media has to be seen from the lens of national security and the threats they pose. Second, India needs to revisit some of its regulations around the social media and bring them up to date with current realities.
While it is not clear whether the current hack into Twitter was done through social engineering or by paying off Twitter employees, it brings forth another question: how did the hackers know who in the social media corporation had access to these internal tools?
It even managed to reset emails as well as bypass two-factor authentication, even for high-profile accounts including a US presidential candidate and targeted them precisely to achieve their goals.
 
The compromised insider is not a first for the social media. In 2017 a Twitter employee temporarily deactivated the US President’s Twitter account and two Twitter employees spied on activists for the Saudi government.
Both these incidents show the power that site reliability engineers (SREs) hold inside the tech company, and how they can be targeted by simply looking at SRE Meetups held in Meetup.com, an online service that hosts regular meetups.
It is then a matter of time to recruit one of them to spy on a critic that a nation state dislikes, or to convince them to give access to internal tools to post a message declaring war on another state, using the head of state’s Twitter account.
 
As the US Navy Chief of Naval Operations put it so eloquently, “social media literacy is national security too”. It is possible that after this incident, this statement has to be retold as “social media SRE is national security too”.
Closer home, in December 2016 Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and many colleagues found their Twitter handles compromised.
According to Indian government sources, this was done by hackers who managed to get domain-level access to the Indian National Congress’ emails, leading to a cascade of hacks including their Twitter handles.
 
No FIRs were filed, and few paid attention to the national security threat such a hack poses.
What if the hack was done by an inimical power to create political chaos in India?
In the polarised political climate that engulfs India, such a creative use of a Twitter hack is very much within the realm of possibility.
Indians still don’t know what happened to Facebook when their data was found to be compromised by Cambridge Analytica.
And the US intelligence community is convinced the Russians successfully used Facebook to influence the 2016 US elections, propelling Donald Trump to an unexpected victory.
 
An unforeseen side effect of this incident would also be a relook on the safe harbour protections that social media companies enjoy. In India the Supreme Court’s Shreya Singhal ruling allows social media companies to indemnify themselves against any risk posed by content posted by one of their users.
The latest Twitter hack raises difficult questions for India and its safe harbour protections for social media companies.
If a single compromised employee can hijack a former US President or a presidential candidate’s account and post messages on bitcoins, does it not imply that the social media platform is no longer an intermediary and now has the power to create content?
 
Accepting that will be a paradigm shift for India’s regulatory landscape for big tech and especially social media companies.
Would we also eventually end up in a situation where SREs with access to sensitive accounts will need a security clearance from the intelligence arm of nation states to avoid an enemy state hijacking the head of state’s account?
It is quite possible it might, and therein lies the significance of this incident. Social media platforms’ internal processes, systems and their engineers might be subjected to public scrutiny in the same way as that of critical infrastructure systems like nuclear plants, power grids and major transport systems.

"It’s quite the no-brainer. The lexicographer’s choice of the year at first appearance was gratuitous, but on closer examination drove home the understanding that plague and Spanish flu notwithstanding, in terms of scope and impact, Covid-19 was the world’s first real “pandemic” which simultaneously gave us a taste of the awful homogeneity technology and globalisation has reduced us to, in a reckoning of sorts.
But that is what the word of the year, or woty, as it is acronymed, and pronounceably so, does; be it lived reality or a culture war, it captures the spirit of the times.

"Even as more and more tests are done in India, a trend involving the well-educated and elite opened a risky can of worms.
Various news reports talk about a wealthy someone throwing a marriage or birthday party, inviting several people to it while putting them all at risk.
 
By not adhering to safety precautions they are, inadvertently, helping in the community spread of the virus.
In her Medium article, ‘Why India’s “Elite” is the Hidden Threat of COVID-19’, writer Shubbu Amin effectively talks about the callousness of the elite class through multiple examples of how they speak about ‘Life has to go on’, ‘Oh, but we’re all fine; we won’t get it’ and ‘We are bored sitting at home’. She adds that while only a hand few can exercise those ‘privileges’, their ‘complaints’ not only apply to partying and socialising in person but also put everyone around them at risk so.
 
COVID-19, the great leveller
Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, Hon State Secretary, Indian Medical Association, Telangana State, is certain it is not time yet to celebrate. Instead, he sheds light on how some among the elite believe nothing could happen to them. “Everybody is equal in the eyes of coronavirus. It won’t stop from infecting you just because you are wealthy,” says Dr Sanjeev.
“Often, people think that money and power will get them everywhere, but now that’s not the case with coronavirus.” Then talking about the number of people he has witnessed placing emergency services car stickers so that they can move around freely, he adds how many even tend to ‘forget’ that they still need to wear a mask while they are comfortably sitting inside their AC cars. “It is the air from outside that the cooling system is venting out, which may carry the virus,” he adds, warning, “People need to understand that for the poor and the working class venturing out for work is a need, whereas for the elite class, visiting a coffee shop or a restaurant is a choice. The coming one month is a crucial time for all in India.”
 
Social distancing still the best option
Dr Viswesvaran Balasubramanian, Senior Interventional Pulmonologist and Sleep Medicine Specialist, Yashoda Hospitals, agrees to the importance of social distancing and how easy it is for the coronavirus to spread in the community.
“Spreading of coronavirus among people is very easy even if you are very careful,” he cautions. “That one sharing of a smoke or drink is enough. Social distancing is the best option to contain the numbers and to ensure you do not risk your near and dear ones.”
 
Pointing out how in the US, someone had organised a Corona Party recently, just for the sake of it, which ended in a couple of the guests dying too, he warns that homes can be a huge source of infection too. “Interestingly, the highest chance of contracting the virus is when there is a social gathering at home or for businessmen when meeting many people regularly.”
Behave responsibly
Dr Nikhil Mathur, Vice President Medical Services CARE Group of Hospitals, also believes that community spread is inevitable especially if people with higher income don’t behave responsibly.
 
“Till an effective vaccine is found and distributed, the use of mask and sanitisers while maintaining social distance should be enforced,” says Dr NIkhil. “There is no point in unnecessarily increasing one’s risk of contracting the virus by visiting a public place. With news coming in that the virus can be airborne and that people can be asymptomatic, even if you remove the mask for a few seconds to have a sip from your soft drink while enjoying with friends at a mall, you are still at risk.”
Then, the doctor talks about how once a person is infected with the virus, they are at risk of infecting many others, some of whom may even not have the means to get treatment.
 
“Elite or not, people are still fighting against the social stigma of being a coronavirus patient. It is important to encourage people to come out if they are not feeling well and report to their authorities and get proper medical help. Also, employers among the elite class need to stop looking beyond their profits and look after their employees in need and not cut salaries if they are not being able to attend work due to illness,” says Dr Nikhil adding, how it is a collective responsibility of all to safeguard themselves.

"How Pilot crashed
The sordid bid to topple the Rajasthan government has exposed the worst in both the Congress party and the BJP.
 
Going by the confessions, the inspired leaks and the whispers, it is clear that chief minister Ashok Gehlot has not been on talking terms with his deputy, Sachin Pilot, since December 2018.
But Gehlot apparently had a line of communication with the former maharani of Dholpur and princess of Gwalior, Vasundhara Raje Scindia.
Sources in both the BJP and the Congress reveal that Gehlot was a step ahead of Pilot simply because someone from Vasundhara Raje's side was tipping him off about Pilot’s moves. Gehlot, a former magician, kept gathering information and piling up a dossier that read like a charge-sheet. The crafty Gehlot did not rush to Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi with this dossier.
 
A chartered plane was reportedly sent to Thiruvananthapuram to fetch AICC general secretary K.C. Venugopal, a favourite of Rahul; he, in turn, handed over the explosive material to the Gandhis.
The Gandhis are now in a dilemma. Their stated position of opposing anyone having truck with the BJP is compromised as both Gehlot and Pilot were reportedly in touch with the enemy.
Corona protocol
Covid-19 has changed a lot in Lutyens’ Delhi. In the Raksha Rajya Mantri’s office for instance, defence ministry personnel are not encouraged to visit unless they are summoned.
 
The informal list of do’s and don’ts at Dr Subhash Bhamre’s office also demands that officers remain seated each time the minister walks in or out.
Baluni fortunate
Union urban development and civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri made a smart move by allocating Priyanka Gandhi’s bungalow — 35, Lodhi Estate, New Delhi — to Amit Shah’s right-hand man Anil Baluni, who also heads the BJP’s media department.
Baluni is recovering from cancer so the sympathy factor also came into play. Puri’s statement that Priyanka tried seeking an extension was quickly denied by the AICC general secretary but it may have a grain of truth.
 
Apparently, without Priyanka’s knowledge or consent, Anand Sharma or K.T.S. Tulsi are suspected to have spoken to Puri even while Priyanka was all set to move out of Lodhi Estate.
Who broke quarantine
Covid-19 continues to bother the political class. At a recently held meeting of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, a senior official sat close to Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, the Congress party leader in the Lok Sabha.
The additional secretary rank babu tested positive for the coronavirus. Everyone, including Chaudhary, had to while away time in home quarantine — other than a BJP notable who is said to have ignored the advice.
 
Sun shines for PR
While the Ashok Gehlot-Sachin Pilot tussle has stressed out a section of the Congress party, some public relations companies are gloating. A prominent Delhi-based PR person, known to have near-perfect relations with many politicians, quickly grabbed Gehlot’s account.
Every morning, scribes and talking heads on TV covering the Rajasthan slugfest have been getting a healthy dose of talking points on WhatsApp. Pilot’s side is not sitting idle. Last heard, Pilot, an accomplished pistol shooter, has engaged some fine PR personalities. They are not missing the target either.

"The net worth of Kiran Mazumdar Shaw in 2020 is $420 crore. But that is not the only reason why the executive chairperson of Biocon evokes admiration amongst her contemporaries.
Kiran has also been conferred with the prestigious IMC Ladies’ Wing —Woman of the Year Award 2019–2020.
 
Vanita Bhandari, the president of the organisation, pays her tribute by saying, “Ms Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw is a shining light who has broken the glass ceiling and paved a successful path in the fields of science and chemistry. Her vision, talent, dedication and philanthropic initiatives motivate us to aspire high.”
Excerpts from the conversation with Ms Shaw:
Now that Biocon’s ‘original’ drug Itolizumab has finally got the much-needed approval, what is your current state of mind?
It is a truly innovative, original drug, which is made in India. We have not copied any other drug. I don’t think anybody has picked this important factor, which is what makes it disappointing.
 
It is life-saving. This is not a small feat. When the disease gets to a serious stage, nothing can help you except drugs like ours. Itolizumab regulates all cytokines in that pathway.
This is a first drug from India that will stand on its own. Why can’t people be proud of a drug made in India? We believed in this drug for the last 20 years. So, it’s a fantastic feeling now.
Many Indian companies are rushing to claim they can make the vaccine available by September/ October, when experts say it’s not possible till next year. Your comments?
 
You can make a vaccine by this period, but the question is if you can deliver a well-validated vaccine. It is like the Russians claiming they have developed the vaccine, which is fine as anyone can make a vaccine.
Today, if Astra Zeneca develops the vaccine, they also have to evaluate it. You have to do this to check whether there is a possibility of being re-infected by the virus.
Secondly, even if you have responded positively to the vaccine, you need to know for how long you are going to be protected. Realistically, you could get a vaccine by the end of this year, but it is vital to check the safety and reliability factor before even I would use it.
 
The ongoing pandemic has changed everyone’s life. What has your learning been from this situation?
It is definitely something to worry about; it is a serious disease and people have still not understood the gravity of the disease.
But it is not necessary that you are going to die. The people who have to worry about COVID-19 are the vulnerable population. I should be worried; I am over 60 but since I don’t have co-morbidities, I am not worried so much about myself, but I have to remain safe as my mom is almost 90 and my husband is 70 and they are both cancer survivors.
 
You are very vocal with your views on social media and otherwise. Are you not worried about anti reactions?
If you are honest and if you have no mal-intent and there is no agenda, nothing will happen. If I have political aspirations, then maybe it will have an impact.
You put a succession plan in place several years back. At a time when the nepotism debate is ongoing, what made you opt for such a radical (at that time) decision?
 I don’t agree with this nepotism debate because if a person is good you must give an opportunity to him/her but you should not give it just because they are your family.
 
For instance, Azim Premji’s son Rishad is a capable youngster who understands the business at Wipro though they have an outside guy at the helm. My niece — a brilliant cancer immunologist, PhD, MBA from Stanford, Masters from MIT — worked at Third Rock Ventures in the US.
I told her to do something for Biocon. I started a small biotech company in Boston and have asked her to run it. But she is the kind of person who has earned it. As far as Biocon biologics is concerned, I don’t think she can run this.
This is a very professional business and so it is helmed by professionals.
You have a strong, admirable relationship with your husband. What is the secret?
 
I just think it is your commitment to anything. First, you have to make a judgement call about the person and then obviously you will have some differences and arguments, all of which happen in a marriage.
But at the same time, it is a commitment you made. For me, my husband has played a very important role in my life. He has really supported me in a fantastic way.
Not many husbands would be happy to support their wives to be at the front. He has always taken the backseat. He always tells me, ‘It is your business... you have to run it and I will support you but you need to lead it.’ That’s a fantastic quality. We have respect for each other.
 
You are a fiercely loyal friend who has stood by Vijay Mallya through all the tough times.
I am just a good, loyal friend, and there are lots of people who are good friends too. In fact, I would often point out to Vijay to see how many of all his fair-weather friends would be with him when the chips are down. I was right. He agrees with me now. I was the only one who would caution him then, but he would never listen to me.

Gehlot, a former magician, kept gathering information and piling up a dossier that read like a charge-sheet. The crafty Gehlot did not rush to Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi with this dossier.
 
A chartered plane was reportedly sent to Thiruvananthapuram to fetch AICC general secretary K.C. Venugopal, a favourite of Rahul; he, in turn, handed over the explosive material to the Gandhis.
The Gandhis are now in a dilemma. Their stated position of opposing anyone having truck with the BJP is compromised as both Gehlot and Pilot were reportedly in touch with the enemy.
Corona protocol
Covid-19 has changed a lot in Lutyens’ Delhi. In the Raksha Rajya Mantri’s office for instance, defence ministry personnel are not encouraged to visit unless they are summoned.
 
The informal list of do’s and don’ts at Dr Subhash Bhamre’s office also demands that officers remain seated each time the minister walks in or out.
Baluni fortunate
Union urban development and civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri made a smart move by allocating Priyanka Gandhi’s bungalow — 35, Lodhi Estate, New Delhi — to Amit Shah’s right-hand man Anil Baluni, who also heads the BJP’s media department.
Baluni is recovering from cancer so the sympathy factor also came into play. Puri’s statement that Priyanka tried seeking an extension was quickly denied by the AICC general secretary but it may have a grain of truth.
 
Apparently, without Priyanka’s knowledge or consent, Anand Sharma or K.T.S. Tulsi are suspected to have spoken to Puri even while Priyanka was all set to move out of Lodhi Estate.
Who broke quarantine
Covid-19 continues to bother the political class. At a recently held meeting of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, a senior official sat close to Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, the Congress party leader in the Lok Sabha.
The additional secretary rank babu tested positive for the coronavirus. Everyone, including Chaudhary, had to while away time in home quarantine — other than a BJP notable who is said to have ignored the advice.
 
Sun shines for PR
While the Ashok Gehlot-Sachin Pilot tussle has stressed out a section of the Congress party, some public relations companies are gloating. A prominent Delhi-based PR person, known to have near-perfect relations with many politicians, quickly grabbed Gehlot’s account.
Every morning, scribes and talking heads on TV covering the Rajasthan slugfest have been getting a healthy dose of talking points on WhatsApp. Pilot’s side is not sitting idle. Last heard, Pilot, an accomplished pistol shooter, has engaged some fine PR personalities. They are not missing the target either.

"It’s amazing how medical technology has advanced. Half a century ago, for instance, cancer meant an almost certain death. Now, about a third of all cancer patients survive. Not all cancers yield readily to treatment, but there are new ways to detect cancer early, and to treat it successfully.
A little further back, in the early 20th century, pernicious anaemia meant almost certain death. Towards the mid-1920s, it became treatable. Its exact cause was discovered in the 1950s: a deficiency of vitamin B12. Treatment was simple, effective, and inexpensive.
 
There’ve been equally amazing advances in the treatment of diseases of the eye, for example. Sixty or seventy years ago, if you had a retinal detachment, the chances were that you’d go blind. Today, methods are so advanced that fixing a detachment is almost a matter of routine.
It’s not just technology: there are outstanding doctors who used some of these inventions to good effect. There’s Christiaan Barnard, for example, who did the first heart transplant back in the 1960s...
Doctors and technology have made huge differences to lives, but sometimes, in individual cases, there’s also the matter of luck, sometimes dumb luck. Let me give you an example.
 
It began in 1976, in Trivandrum, not long before my school exams. My parents were worried about the effect of all that swotting on my weak eyes: I’d used spectacles since I was 10, and the lenses got thicker every year. My parents thought that contact lenses would reduce the eyestrain, and decided that I deserved a pair, which was good news, because it meant a good excuse to bunk school.
The only place where you could check out contact lenses was the Government Ophthalmic  Hospital, which we knew very well, thanks to those weak eyes.
 
Dad and I went there one sunny morning, and bumped into a technician he knew. He told Dad to leave me with him and not to worry, so I found myself alone in the large, crowded waiting hall, with just enough money to get back home.
Soon a lady doctor turned up, led me to a small chamber furnished with benches, put some drops in my eyes. Some 15 minutes, she inserted lenses into my eyes, and told me to wait awhile. With the lenses in place, I could see rather better, and I enjoyed that for a while. But then, I’d been up half the night reading a new Alistair MacLean thriller, and the waiting was making me unbearably sleepy. Some minutes after the doctor left, I lay down on one of the benches and dozed off.
 
When I woke, the world was blurred again. I had no idea what had happened to the contact lenses. I thought they might have fallen off while I slept, so I spent the next few minutes on my hands and knees, feeling the entire dusty concrete floor for those fragile bits of glass, and despaired when I couldn’t find them.
When the doctor returned I told her I’d lost the lenses. Perhaps she was new: she wasn’t quite sure what to do so, she fetched help in the shape of an older lady doctor. This new doctor found the lenses at the sides of my eyes and retrieved them gently, all the while giving me a lecture on my irresponsible behaviour.
 
When the lenses were safely out, she relented, perhaps because of my nerdy looks, and offered me a bit of advice: if I studied regularly, she said, I wouldn’t have to lose sleep over exams. She saw my heavy spectacles, and continued, “Hmmm! Let me have a good look at your eyes.”
She led me to a dark room with instruments with glowing lights and many handles and levers. After a longish inspection, she shut off everything and led me back to the room with the benches. “You need some minor surgery in both eyes,” she said, “but we can’t do it here. You’ll have to go to Madras for it... It’s nothing very serious, but you have to get it done. Come back tomorrow with your father. Ask for me. My name is Mary Kuriakose.”
 
Next day, she spoke almost exclusively to Dad. “Your son’s retina has weak spots,” she said, “but we can strengthen those. One Dr Badrinath in Madras will do it.”
“He’s got his exams coming up,” Dad said. “Can it wait until after that?”
She smiled. “It’ll have to,” she said. “You’ll have to wait at least two months for your appointment.” She handed Dad a letter referring me to Dr Badrinath. “Write to him immediately.”
Dr Badrinath, was a large, reassuring man with an American accent. He took the time to explain the problem to me, and not just to Dad, and the procedure went off smoothly. One round of treatment wasn’t enough, and, over the next few years, it was repeated several times. Meanwhile, technology kept progressing.
By the 1990s, retinal detachments could be treated with a good chance of success, much better than in the late 1980s.
 
And so, when I had a retinal detachment last year, fixing it was a routine operation, something that wouldn’t have been possible a quarter of century ago.
Then, earlier this year, my friend Dr Kamath found that the cataract in the good eye needed to be removed, and did so late in June. As this goes to press, I’m still recovering from this round of surgery, and, with any luck, won’t need any more.
So, I’m grateful to dumb luck. If I hadn’t gone to sleep in that waiting room nearly half a century ago, I wouldn’t have seen Dr Kuriakose, and would probably have had my troubles before they could have been treated so smoothly. I’m grateful to her, for starting this chain of events. So, from the bottom of my heart, here’s to you, Dr Kuriakose.

"The net worth of Kiran Mazumdar Shaw in 2020 is $420 crore. But that is not the only reason why the executive chairperson of Biocon evokes admiration amongst her contemporaries.
Kiran has also been conferred with the prestigious IMC Ladies’ Wing —Woman of the Year Award 2019–2020.
 
Vanita Bhandari, the president of the organisation, pays her tribute by saying, “Ms Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw is a shining light who has broken the glass ceiling and paved a successful path in the fields of science and chemistry. Her vision, talent, dedication and philanthropic initiatives motivate us to aspire high.”
Excerpts from the conversation with Ms Shaw:
Now that Biocon’s ‘original’ drug Itolizumab has finally got the much-needed approval, what is your current state of mind?
It is a truly innovative, original drug, which is made in India. We have not copied any other drug. I don’t think anybody has picked this important factor, which is what makes it disappointing.
 
It is life-saving. This is not a small feat. When the disease gets to a serious stage, nothing can help you except drugs like ours. Itolizumab regulates all cytokines in that pathway.
This is a first drug from India that will stand on its own. Why can’t people be proud of a drug made in India? We believed in this drug for the last 20 years. So, it’s a fantastic feeling now.
Many Indian companies are rushing to claim they can make the vaccine available by September/ October, when experts say it’s not possible till next year. Your comments?
 
You can make a vaccine by this period, but the question is if you can deliver a well-validated vaccine. It is like the Russians claiming they have developed the vaccine, which is fine as anyone can make a vaccine.
Today, if Astra Zeneca develops the vaccine, they also have to evaluate it. You have to do this to check whether there is a possibility of being re-infected by the virus.
Secondly, even if you have responded positively to the vaccine, you need to know for how long you are going to be protected. Realistically, you could get a vaccine by the end of this year, but it is vital to check the safety and reliability factor before even I would use it.
 
The ongoing pandemic has changed everyone’s life. What has your learning been from this situation?
It is definitely something to worry about; it is a serious disease and people have still not understood the gravity of the disease.
But it is not necessary that you are going to die. The people who have to worry about COVID-19 are the vulnerable population. I should be worried; I am over 60 but since I don’t have co-morbidities, I am not worried so much about myself, but I have to remain safe as my mom is almost 90 and my husband is 70 and they are both cancer survivors.
 
You are very vocal with your views on social media and otherwise. Are you not worried about anti reactions?
If you are honest and if you have no mal-intent and there is no agenda, nothing will happen. If I have political aspirations, then maybe it will have an impact.
You put a succession plan in place several years back. At a time when the nepotism debate is ongoing, what made you opt for such a radical (at that time) decision?
 I don’t agree with this nepotism debate because if a person is good you must give an opportunity to him/her but you should not give it just because they are your family.
 
For instance, Azim Premji’s son Rishad is a capable youngster who understands the business at Wipro though they have an outside guy at the helm. My niece — a brilliant cancer immunologist, PhD, MBA from Stanford, Masters from MIT — worked at Third Rock Ventures in the US.
I told her to do something for Biocon. I started a small biotech company in Boston and have asked her to run it. But she is the kind of person who has earned it. As far as Biocon biologics is concerned, I don’t think she can run this.
This is a very professional business and so it is helmed by professionals.
You have a strong, admirable relationship with your husband. What is the secret?
 
I just think it is your commitment to anything. First, you have to make a judgement call about the person and then obviously you will have some differences and arguments, all of which happen in a marriage.
But at the same time, it is a commitment you made. For me, my husband has played a very important role in my life. He has really supported me in a fantastic way.
Not many husbands would be happy to support their wives to be at the front. He has always taken the backseat. He always tells me, ‘It is your business... you have to run it and I will support you but you need to lead it.’ That’s a fantastic quality. We have respect for each other.
 
You are a fiercely loyal friend who has stood by Vijay Mallya through all the tough times.
I am just a good, loyal friend, and there are lots of people who are good friends too. In fact, I would often point out to Vijay to see how many of all his fair-weather friends would be with him when the chips are down. I was right. He agrees with me now. I was the only one who would caution him then, but he would never listen to me.

"His bio on Instagram catches the eye. Cinematographer and director of photography for a NatGeo film on Black Panthers the first in the world of wildlife. Hailing from Hyderabad’s illustrious Jung family, Shaaz’s wildlife images have earned him a place in BBC news.
 
An accomplishment that his proud aunt, Kareena Kapoor highlighted on her Insta account. We chat with this talented youngster on the jungle life.
Q What has kept you busy right now?
I’ve dedicated the past five years to documenting melanistic leopards in the jungles of South India and helped produce a feature film for National Geographic recently, for which I was the Director of Photography. It took us two and a half years to finish the film. It feels great to make a film, for the first time in the world of wildlife, on a black panther.
 
Q Your involvement with the family owned wildlife resorts in Kabini and South Africa?
My parents (Saad Bin Jung and Sangeeta) are avid wildlifers and were one of the first pioneers for eco-tourism in Karnataka. That passionate outburst happened after I graduated from University in 2010. I moved to Nagarhole National Park and helped establish an eco-friendly wildlife resort on the banks of the Kabini reservoir. This is where I spend most of my time guiding, photographing and making films.
Q How did your interest in wildlife photography evolve?
It happened after I saw my first leopard, which sparked my love affair with the woods. The camera had the ability to immortalise moments, relish life, protect ecosystems, inspire movements and spark change.
 
Q What has been the most thrilling moment while shooting wildlife?
It would be on safari in the Serengeti this year. I was guiding a group of six avid photographers in an open jeep and we were parked in the tall grass with a herd of Water Buffalos, which are considered to be one of the most dangerous animals in Africa. We knew there was a hungry lioness around but we had no idea where she was. After several anxious minutes, one of the buffalos sensed her presence and was now very disturbed. We were surrounded by an angry herd and they had the power to upturn our jeep in seconds. After a few nervous seconds, the lioness broke cover and charged at a buffalo calf. It caused a stampede and one of the bulls, in a raging fit, destroyed the left tyre of our car. It was terrifying!
 
Q What has your time in the jungle taught you? Is your wife as passionate about nature as you are?
The jungle has taught me the art of patience. It’s inhabitants, such as the beautiful leopards, have been my mentors. They’ve taught me to live by the day and how to appreciate the passing of time, and not let it worry us. My wife Nayantara grew up in New York. After we got married, she moved to the jungle and has quickly adapted, almost like a leopard! She enjoys the wilderness and helped produce the National Geographic feature film on the black panther.

These are classic examples of the misplaced belief that ‘Nothing will happen to me’. Sanjay Gulabani, chairman, P. Mangatram Jewellers, says,
 
“Each one of us needs to act responsibly. For the economy to not get further beaten out of shape, the lockdown was relaxed. The purpose of the lockdown was to create awareness and get people ready to adapt to the new codes. It is up to us to be judicious in protecting our health,” he pointed out.

"Who’s that attorney?
The induction of a law officer from Gujarat as additional solicitor general has suddenly turned up the legal heat on many in the national capital, particularly those belonging to the UPA regime. Senior lawyer S.V. Raju was appointed as ASG and brought from Gujarat.
 
The legal community is abuzz with reports that Mr Raju has a direct line to the “Big Two” and is keeping them informed about pending and fresh legal cases. AICC treasurer Ahmed Patel is already facing the heat from the Enforcement Directorate. More drama and trouble for the Congress is expected in the coming months.
Like father, unlike son
Shourya Doval is a man of many shades. Hailing from the Garhwal region, young Doval seems keen to chalk out his own path distinct from his illustrious father, national security advisor Ajit Doval.
 
During the 2019 parliamentary polls, Uttarakhand was rife with rumour that Shourya would be fielded from the Pauri Garhwal seat but local political dynamics played out differently. Shourya has been taking an active interest in the socio-cultural activities in the hill state. He was recently spotted in an online programme that was organised by Congress leader Harish Rawat.
Nath still in reckoning
Madhya Pradesh is the number one tiger state in the country. But who is tiger number one? A political debate and war of words is raging in the central Indian state with both chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia delivering Salman Khan’s dialogue, “Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai”.
 
On the political barometer, Scindia seems one up on Chouhan having managed to get all his supporters inducted in the Chouhan ministry while the CM cut a sorry figure in having to keep out many of his loyal supporters who were ministerial colleagues in the previous BJP regime.
Crucial Assembly by-polls in 24 seats will be held shortly where all 24 (mostly MLAs who had defected from the Congress to BJP with Scindia) will be in the fray. The Congress is hoping to get at least half of them defeated. If that happens, it will be Kamal Nath’s turn to say, “Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai”.
 
Cricketing ‘estate’
While speculation was rife that the late Arun Jaitley’s daughter Sonali Jaitley Bakshi may join politics, the former minister's son Rohan is said to be keen to pursue his dad’s passion for cricket administration.
The Delhi and District Cricket Association poll is on the cards to fill six vacant posts — president, treasurer and four directors. The two key positions of president and treasurer have been vacant since Rajat Sharma tendered his resignation on November 29, 2019, and O.P. Sharma was disqualified from office as treasurer. Ombudsman Justice (Retd) Deepak Verma ordered Sharma’s disqualification as treasurer as he is an elected member of the Delhi legislative Assembly. If Rohan contests and wins he will be occupying a post that was once held by Arun Jaitley.
 
PM’s subterfuge
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise visit to Leh was well-planned. Informed sources say that as per strategy, defence minister Rajnath Singh’s name was first announced. Hours before Modi’s visit, the defence minister called off his tour to Ladakh where Chinese forces have adopted an aggressive posture. Rajnath was kept in the loop throughout. He was first to go public in lauding the PM’s inspiring speech delivered at Nimu base.

The coronavirus crisis has crumpled the social fabric of our lives and the fashion industry like. Be it the way we address our financial goals or the way we dress.
Even as fashion titans like Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci and some Indian designers are casting their bread upon the waters to create safe and sustainable clothing (including PPE), the most that we can do is wait. And watch!
Fashion historians point out that people changed their dressing style after the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the Great Depression and World War II. The 2020 Covid-19 pandemic is no exception.
 
With retailers and clothing units shutting shop, and millions of workers scrambling to make ends meet, nobody frankly knows the future of fashion or the new ‘quarantrends’.
A la Mode
Some designers say dressier days are on the horizon as people would want to spread cheer and positive vibes. Some opine dull and somber attire goes with the current mood. Yet, a few others are optimistic of the easy-on-the-eye-and-pocket florals.
The online market of second-hand and recycled clothes, shoes and accessories has already seen a spike. You may nod and naff in equal measure, but it looks like Back to Basics!
 
Ritu Kumar, the doyenne of Indian fashion industry, who began her career in 1969 with just four hand block printers and two tables in a small village near Calcutta (now Kolkata), says that there were recessionary trends in the fashion industry even before the pandemic.
“Business had slowed down after demonetisation. Now, there will be a trend of need-based buying. I won’t be surprised if we are pushed back by another 20 years,” says Kumar, whose understanding of ancient Indian designs, traditional crafts and Indian fashion market is unmatched.
 
She adds that you cannot compare the Indian fashion industry to the international ones. “The fashion industry in the western world has been there for over 100-150 years. The Indian fashion industry has been around for only 30-40 years.”
However, Kumar feels the saree, kurta and kurtis will make a comeback to beat the corona blues. “A saree suits all occasions. It is low on maintenance too. Men usually spend on branded shirts and trousers. But now people will move towards ethnic wear. The kurta will be the much-favoured choice for men and women,” she says.
 
Beleaguered Workforce
India has an estimated 16 million crafts-people working in the textile industry.  A majority of them in rural areas and are involved in the most intricate work like weaving, embroidery and creation of embellishments etc.
These craftsmen have mastered their craft over centuries and passed it on from one generation to the other. The pandemic has brought about an “unprecedented” crisis.
Today, thousands of craftsmen are without work. Customers are still hesitant to enter malls and shops to buy clothes although there has been a spike in online shopping.
 
Jugnu Gosrani, a Mumbai-based designer, who creates free-spirited clothes, says all her sales are online.
“We are all saddled with unsold merchandise. This month, I managed to sell kurtis, dresses and skirts online in my housing society itself. Customers order online. I leave the outfit outside their door in a sealed plastic bag,” explains Jugnu. She is certain that people will stick to affordable and sustainable clothes.
The only ‘In thing’ right now are protective masks. Jeans, joggers and leggings are also in demand. Whether you step out to run errands or go for a jog. The mask is here to stay for a long time. “I’m making kalamkari masks from the leftover fabrics,” Jugnu adds.

Grapevine from the fashion circuit tells us that nearly four designers and their loved ones have had a close brush with the virus. Earlier, designers had to run the gauntlet of TV cameras and fashion photographers.
 
Now, it will take plenty of pluck to re-fashion one’s business model and pull through the mess. The Fashion Design Council of India has already announced a Covid-19 Support Fund for small businesses and young designers in need.
Ritu Kumar is certain that fast fashion will be out. “In India, people purchase clothes for functions and festivals (Diwali, Eid, Christmas, Baisakhi) unlike the west where the fashion ramp is dictated by changing seasons and colours.” Kumar is optimistic that people will bounce back. “We will have to focus on ‘Make in India’ to pull through this crisis,” she says.  
 
Make Every Outfit Count
Today, millions of people are either out of work or have taken pay cuts. The recession has forced people to set their priorities and rethink their spending.  Nishit Gupta, director of KALKI says people are tired of this panic mode.
“Fashion trends will vary as the world slowly emerges from the global quarantine. With weddings now becoming more intimate, smaller in size, the fusion trends will find favour with both brides and bridesmaids. Mirror lehengas, organza skirts, pre-stitched sarees, necklet gowns, dhoti-crop tops in handwoven fabrics and hand-done embroideries with traditional textile techniques will trend. It will also help support the rural artisans and handloom communities,” says Nishit.
 
The pandemic shockwaves have hit every industry. The ‘new normal’ will make us slow down, and reinvent how we view consumption and production.
“If you view forecasts, by next year from a slated -4% drop this year in the GDP, we may be able to achieve a growth of 4% in 2021, provided we take control of the production and job creation by being self sufficient,” says Bahaar Dhawan Rohatgi, a Delhi-based lawyer-cum-visual artist and influencer.
She hopes the fashion sector will become more responsible and sustainable.
 
“I hope aficionados will promote products that employ environmental-friendly, fair practices, minimise waste and boast functionality. We may witness a tipping point where designers will be drawn to celebrate austerity, emphasising a classless society (remember post war ‘Austerity Britain drive’ in the 1940s) signifying affordability, access to leisure, health, value life and maintaining balance,” says Bahaar. Perhaps need-based sustainable dressing is the glamour we’ve been missing!

"As a reprisal to China’s incursions into Indian territory, the Narendra Modi government has banned 59 Chinese apps because they were allegedly ""prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order"".

"Who’s that attorney?
The induction of a law officer from Gujarat as additional solicitor general has suddenly turned up the legal heat on many in the national capital, particularly those belonging to the UPA regime. Senior lawyer S.V. Raju was appointed as ASG and brought from Gujarat.
 
The legal community is abuzz with reports that Mr Raju has a direct line to the “Big Two” and is keeping them informed about pending and fresh legal cases. AICC treasurer Ahmed Patel is already facing the heat from the Enforcement Directorate. More drama and trouble for the Congress is expected in the coming months.
Like father, unlike son
Shourya Doval is a man of many shades. Hailing from the Garhwal region, young Doval seems keen to chalk out his own path distinct from his illustrious father, national security advisor Ajit Doval.
 
During the 2019 parliamentary polls, Uttarakhand was rife with rumour that Shourya would be fielded from the Pauri Garhwal seat but local political dynamics played out differently. Shourya has been taking an active interest in the socio-cultural activities in the hill state. He was recently spotted in an online programme that was organised by Congress leader Harish Rawat.
Nath still in reckoning
Madhya Pradesh is the number one tiger state in the country. But who is tiger number one? A political debate and war of words is raging in the central Indian state with both chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia delivering Salman Khan’s dialogue, “Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai”.
 
On the political barometer, Scindia seems one up on Chouhan having managed to get all his supporters inducted in the Chouhan ministry while the CM cut a sorry figure in having to keep out many of his loyal supporters who were ministerial colleagues in the previous BJP regime.
Crucial Assembly by-polls in 24 seats will be held shortly where all 24 (mostly MLAs who had defected from the Congress to BJP with Scindia) will be in the fray. The Congress is hoping to get at least half of them defeated. If that happens, it will be Kamal Nath’s turn to say, “Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai”.
 
Cricketing ‘estate’
While speculation was rife that the late Arun Jaitley’s daughter Sonali Jaitley Bakshi may join politics, the former minister's son Rohan is said to be keen to pursue his dad’s passion for cricket administration.
The Delhi and District Cricket Association poll is on the cards to fill six vacant posts — president, treasurer and four directors. The two key positions of president and treasurer have been vacant since Rajat Sharma tendered his resignation on November 29, 2019, and O.P. Sharma was disqualified from office as treasurer. Ombudsman Justice (Retd) Deepak Verma ordered Sharma’s disqualification as treasurer as he is an elected member of the Delhi legislative Assembly. If Rohan contests and wins he will be occupying a post that was once held by Arun Jaitley.
 
PM’s subterfuge
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise visit to Leh was well-planned. Informed sources say that as per strategy, defence minister Rajnath Singh’s name was first announced. Hours before Modi’s visit, the defence minister called off his tour to Ladakh where Chinese forces have adopted an aggressive posture. Rajnath was kept in the loop throughout. He was first to go public in lauding the PM’s inspiring speech delivered at Nimu base.

No Big Spenders  
Designer Rina Dhaka feels it is impossible to quantify the losses since it is interlinked from retail giants to exporters to the migrant workers. “Work is a struggle and one is trying to get up again,” she says.
After the pandemic, Rina plans to move back to crafts, wovens and sustainable models of fashion. “I will also simplify the couture. Maybe more as singles or separates to make the spending easier,” she says.  
Grapevine from the fashion circuit tells us that nearly four designers and their loved ones have had a close brush with the virus. Earlier, designers had to run the gauntlet of TV cameras and fashion photographers.
 
Now, it will take plenty of pluck to re-fashion one’s business model and pull through the mess. The Fashion Design Council of India has already announced a Covid-19 Support Fund for small businesses and young designers in need.

It will also help support the rural artisans and handloom communities,” says Nishit.
 
The pandemic shockwaves have hit every industry. The ‘new normal’ will make us slow down, and reinvent how we view consumption and production.

Sushmita is sexy, glamorous, glowing, fit, and she commands and controls the camera’s lens as if it were her drooling fan. Sushmita is also a star and she brings all her star power to ground Aarya. But Sushmita isn’t a great actress. Her acting chops are limited to giving a few “looks”.
That's why the show’s directors have had to conspire with cinematographer Harshvir Oberai and editors (Khushboo Ra, Abhimanyu Chaudhary) to cut, chop, fade, zoom in, go slomo, use every trick available to insinuate that she is acting, moving, while keeping her gorgeous face and its one expression on the screen.
 
But Sushmita Sen’s repertoire is too tiny, too meagre for us to be fooled.
We love her warm charm, but hope that by season two she grows from just giving a “look” and learns to transition from one expression to another without the help of editing.
Aarya is based on the Dutch series Penoza (meaning, the underworld), which began airing in 2010, was a huge hit and went on for five seasons. Penoza told the story of Carmen, an Amsterdam woman — a wife, a mother, and then a widow and a godmother — who is forced to take over her husband’s business to pay off his various debts.
 
It was remade in the US because of the universal appeal of its themes of love, loyalty, betrayal and family ties, but it didn’t fly. Now the series, about a mother protecting her children, has found a happy, natural home in Rajasthan, India.
Set in the desert state's rotting mini-royalty, Aarya’s first season is based on the original almost scene-by-scene, with just a few changes thrown in to fit its milieu.   
The series' first and last episodes open with Aarya (Sushmita Sen) hanging upside down on TRX straps, a familiar sight for those who follow Ms Sen’s Instagram account.
 
In between these two scenes is the story of three business partners, a stolen drug consignment, a murder and a woman torn between her two families -- father, mother, sister and brother on one side, and husband, daughter and two sons on the other.
A cop is after business secrets, the mafia is after the drugs, a business partner has begun to unravel and everyone seems to be hiding something.
As Aarya takes charge, some things go as planned, while others don’t.
Another murder, a kidnapping, deceit. With every threat coiling around her family, tightening its grip, Aarya's moral compass shifts to one that is beyond all moral considerations -- the mother who will protect her brood at all cost.
 
Every time things get too dreary, Aarya distracts itself and us by playing some LP records of Bollywood oldies — to take a deep breath and relive happy memories before the next dark twist.
This is the series' trick that keeps us hooked. Like Aarya, we too yearn for the husband-wife in love, the sunshine days of a happy family…

I have a very simple test of how good a serial is. If I binge watch it in one go while battling sleep and despite a busy early morning looming, then it's very good.
If I can take a break, but must then return to it asap, then it's good. And if I take a break but then browse around for other stuff, it's blah.
 
Aarya is good. Quite good, actually. But I could take a day’s break.
It's not Pataal Lok good, though Aarya more than makes up for the dearth of women in that masculine, macho series.
Half-way through Aarya I could figure who is behind it all, yet I was immersed in the intrigues of this world of Audis and Mercs, mistresses and sex, because of the excellent ensemble of actors and its brilliant screenplay.
Though it’s almost a copy-cut-paste job of the original, Aarya has a high production value, it looks and feels posh and its big scenes are made up of lovely, small details.
 
Aarya has a long list of actors, and each one gets a character that either has layers and complications or grand, powerful scenes. And while everyone is good, some are just stand-out fabulous.  
Chandrachur Singh as Aarya's husband Tej is delightfully normal and adorable. Jayant Kripalani as Aarya's father Zorawar, with Sikandar Kher as his point man Daulat, are deliciously dark and together they create the swag and rot of Rajasthani royalty.
Namit Das as the coke-snorting Jawahar is manic, unpredictable, and Vikas Kumar as the earnest but annoying ACP Khan creates a character that will outlive the series.
 
Manish Choudhary as the Russians’ peddler-distributor Shekhawat, Vishwajeet Pradhan as his man Sampat, Sohaila Kapur as Zorawar's bitter, day-drinking wife Rajeshwari, and Maya Sarao as Maya all have a few big scenes and with each one they add muscle and moxie to the series.
 
Even the three kids — played by Virti Vaghani, Viren Vazirani and Pratyaksh Panwar — are measured, memorable.
Writers Sandeep Srivastav and Anu Singh Choudhary have embellished Sushmita’s character with items from her life, making it, in some ways, an extension of the actor’s own personality.
 
Apart from the hanging routine, there's rousing chanting of stanzas from the Gita, again a regular feature on Sushmita's Instagram.
Sushmita's character, which has been given an Eileen Fisher type of layered, minimalist but chic mommy wardrobe, keeps calling all her children “Bachcha”, instead of by their name.
A trait of a woman who is a natural caregiver, perhaps. But it’s jarring and sticks out as an affectation because of Sushmita's studied attempt at ""acting"",
Sushmita has powerful screen presence, but her dialogue delivery is the sort you hear in acting classes — rehearsed, deliberate, read out.
 
She's got everything going for her. All she needs now is a little fluidity and to shed some of her diva gold dust.

"Paris: Tech giants love to portray themselves as forces for good and as the United States was gripped by anti-racism protests a number of them publicly disavowed selling controversial facial recognition technology to police forces.
Facial recognition has numerous applications that could simplify our lives as we’ve seen with Apple using it to unlock smartphones or in stores to replace cash registers.
 
But the technology has a dark side, with facial recognition integrated into China’s massive public surveillance system and its social credit experiment where even minor infractions of public norms can result in sanctions.
As the protests spread across the United States about police violence and racism, pressure mounted on tech firms about the technology. Microsoft and Amazon announced they would suspend sales of facial recognition software to police forces while IBM said it would exit the business.
Privacy and rights groups worry about the implications of the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement.
 
‘Extremely intrusive’ technology        
“It is an extremely intrusive form of surveillance and can seriously undermine our freedoms and eventually our society as a whole,” says Privacy International.
“The biggest danger is that this technology will be used for general, suspicionless surveillance systems,” says for its part the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
It notes that US state governments hold extensive photo databases as part of their motor vehicle departments, which if combined with public surveillance or other cameras, could result in “a comprehensive system of identification and tracking”.
 
In January 2020, a New York Times investigation pulled back the curtain on the activities of Californian startup Clearview AI, whose facial recognition tool “could end your ability to walk down the street anonymously”.
Social network photos scraped          
That is because Clearview AI doesn’t use photos held by governments, but billions of photos scraped from social media sites.
While social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube (Google) and LinkedIn (Microsoft) protested against the unsanctioned use of their users’ photos, Clearview hasn’t acceded to their demands to delete them.
 
The firm, which received funding from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, says it has already signed up 600 law enforcement agencies worldwide.
According to advocacy group AlgorithmWatch, at least 10 European police forces already use facial recognition technology and haven’t needed to turn to the tech giants.
“I have never seen a contract between Microsoft, Amazon or IBM and a police force in the investigations I have done on the subject,” said journalist Nicolas Kayser-Bril, who did the research behind the AlgorithmWatch report.
 
Technology already widely available              
“Tools for conducting facial recognition are widely available,” he added, noting that BriefCam, a subsidiary of Japanese multinational Canon which specialises in ultra-rapid analysis of images, is one of the leaders in the European market.
China has begun to export its facial recognition technology, particularly via its telecoms equipment giant Huawei.
A company executive told a business forum in Morocco last year that with its technology not only the identity of a person can be identified, but educational and work experience, personal preferences and recent travel.
 
In February, The Intercept cited a report that 10 European police forces are considering a joint network for facial recognition searches by extending agreements in place that allow sharing of biometric information like DNA and fingerprints.
France’s interior ministry is expected to unveil soon proposals to widen the use of the technology, with officials keen to be able to use in certain cases such as terrorist attacks and child kidnappings.

"As a reprisal to China’s incursions into Indian territory, the Narendra Modi government has banned 59 Chinese apps because they were allegedly ""prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order"".

It notes that US state governments hold extensive photo databases as part of their motor vehicle departments, which if combined with public surveillance or other cameras, could result in “a comprehensive system of identification and tracking”.
 
In January 2020, a New York Times investigation pulled back the curtain on the activities of Californian startup Clearview AI, whose facial recognition tool “could end your ability to walk down the street anonymously”.
Social network photos scraped          
That is because Clearview AI doesn’t use photos held by governments, but billions of photos scraped from social media sites.
While social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube (Google) and LinkedIn (Microsoft) protested against the unsanctioned use of their users’ photos, Clearview hasn’t acceded to their demands to delete them.
 
The firm, which received funding from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, says it has already signed up 600 law enforcement agencies worldwide.
According to advocacy group AlgorithmWatch, at least 10 European police forces already use facial recognition technology and haven’t needed to turn to the tech giants.
“I have never seen a contract between Microsoft, Amazon or IBM and a police force in the investigations I have done on the subject,” said journalist Nicolas Kayser-Bril, who did the research behind the AlgorithmWatch report.
 
Technology already widely available              
“Tools for conducting facial recognition are widely available,” he added, noting that BriefCam, a subsidiary of Japanese multinational Canon which specialises in ultra-rapid analysis of images, is one of the leaders in the European market.
China has begun to export its facial recognition technology, particularly via its telecoms equipment giant Huawei.
A company executive told a business forum in Morocco last year that with its technology not only the identity of a person can be identified, but educational and work experience, personal preferences and recent travel.
 
In February, The Intercept cited a report that 10 European police forces are considering a joint network for facial recognition searches by extending agreements in place that allow sharing of biometric information like DNA and fingerprints.
France’s interior ministry is expected to unveil soon proposals to widen the use of the technology, with officials keen to be able to use in certain cases such as terrorist attacks and child kidnappings.

"New Delhi: Most mobile applications that track the spread of COVID-19 require access to users’ personal data, but only a handful indicate the data would be anonymous, encrypted and secured, according to a study by Indian-origin researchers in the US.
Professor Masooda Bashir and doctoral student Tanusree Sharma from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign analysed 50 COVID-19-related apps available in the Google Play store for their access to users’ personal data and their privacy protections.
 
The researchers noted that it is disconcerting that these apps are continuously collecting and processing highly sensitive and personally identifiable information, about health, location and direct identifiers like name, age, email address and voter or national identification of a user.
“Governments’ use of such tracking technology—and the possibilities for how they might use it after the pandemic—is chilling to many,” the researchers wrote in the study published in the journal Nature Medicine.
“Notably, surveillance mapping through apps will allow governments to identify people’s travel paths and their entire social networks,” they noted.
 
The researchers explained that functionalities of the COVID-related apps developed around the world include live maps and updates of confirmed cases, real-time location-based alerts, systems for monitoring home isolation and quarantine, direct reporting to the government of symptoms, and education about COVID-19.
Some also offer monitoring of vital signs, virtual medical consultations and community-driven contact tracing, the said.
Of the 50 apps the researchers evaluated, 30 require users’ permission to access data from their mobile devices such as contacts, photos, media, files, location data, the camera.
 
These 30 apps also require the device’s ID, call information, Wi-Fi connection, microphone, network access, the Google service configuration, and the ability to change network connectivity and audio settings, according to the study.
Some of the apps, the researchers said, state they will collect users’ age, email address, phone number and postal code; the device’s location, unique identifiers, mobile IP address and operating system; and the types of browsers used on the device.
Only 16 of the apps indicated such data will be anonymous, encrypted, secured and reported only in aggregate form, they said.
 
Of the apps sampled in the study, 20 were issued by governments, health ministries and other such official sources.
The researchers acknowledged that mass surveillance measures may be necessary to contain the spread of the virus.
“Health care providers must absolutely use whatever means are available to save lives and confine the spread of the virus,” they wrote in the journal.
However, the researchers added that it is up to the rest, especially those in the field of information privacy and security, to ask the questions needed to protect the right to privacy.

"San Francisco: Snapchat on Wednesday became the latest social network moving to curb the reach of US President Donald Trump, claiming the president has been inciting “racial violence.”
The youth-focused social network said it would no longer promote Trump on its Discover platform for recommended content.
 
“We will not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice by giving them free promotion on Discover,” a statement from Snapchat said.
The move came days after Twitter took an unprecedented stand by hiding a Trump post it said promoted violence, heating up the White House war with Silicon Valley and social media.
Snapchat parent Snap chief executive Evan Spiegel over the weekend sent a lengthy memo to employees condemning what he saw as a legacy of racial injustice and violence in the US.
Snapchat will not promote accounts in the US that are linked to people who incite racial violence on or off the messaging platform, according Spiegel.
 
“Every minute we are silent in the face of evil and wrongdoing we are acting in support of evildoers,” Spiegel wrote as companies responded to the outrage over the police killing of a black man in Minnesota.
“I am heartbroken and enraged by the treatment of black people and people of color in America.”
The Discover feature at Snapchat is a curated platform on which the California-based company gets to decide what it recommends to users.
No longer recommended         
Trump’s account remains on the platform, it will just no longer be recommended viewing, according to Snapchat.
 
“We will make it clear with our actions that there is no gray area when it comes to racism, violence, and injustice—and we will not promote it, nor those who support it, on our platform,” Spiegel said in the memo.
Snapchat is particularly popular with young internet users, claiming that about half of the US “Generation Z” population tapping into news through its Discover feature.
“There are plenty of debates to be had about the future of our country and the world,” Spiegel said.
“But there is simply no room for debate in our country about the value of human life and the importance of a constant struggle for freedom, equality, and justice.”
 
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale denounced the move, claiming that “Snapchat is trying to rig the 2020 election, illegally using their corporate funding to promote Joe Biden and suppress President Trump.”
Parscale said in a statement: “Snapchat hates that so many of their users watch the president’s content and so they are actively engaging in voter suppression... If you’re a conservative, they do not want to hear from you, they do not want you to vote. They view you as a deplorable and they do not want you to exist on their platform.”
 
Facebook looks away               
The move by Twitter last week prompted an angry response by Trump, who within days signed an executive order calling for heightened government oversight of social platforms.
Trump accuses the platforms of “censorship” and limiting “free speech,” but his critics say the president has distorted the interpretation of those terms and is himself seeking to regulate online content.
In contrast to Twitter and Snapchat, Facebook has defended his decision not to interfere with posts by Trump.
 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated his position in a call with employees this week, according to reports, despite criticism of the Facebook policy by civil rights activists.
The coronavirus pandemic has put an abrupt stop to traditional US political means of courting young voters—forcing presidential candidates to turn to Snapchat instead.
The photo-sending app that boasts 229 million users—better known for filters that turn your face into a puppy or a vampire—is a new battlefield for opponents Trump and Biden, both of whom are in their 70s.
 
Last month, Ken Farnaso, the Trump campaign deputy press secretary, told AFP that Snapchat was an important element of the re-election effort and that the Republican was ahead of Biden on the platform.
“It’s clear that we’re wiping the floor with Biden’s campaign,” Farnaso said of the Snapchat effort.

"New York: A tech-focused civil liberties group on Tuesday sued to block President Donald Trump’s executive order that seeks to regulate social media, saying it violates the First Amendment and puts curbs on free speech.
Trump’s order, signed last week, could allow more lawsuits against internet companies like Twitter and Facebook for what their users post, tweet and stream.
 
The order was more political than substantive, with many experts questioning whether it was constitutional. The president aimed to rally his supporters after Twitter put fact checks on two of his tweets. Trump, without evidence, has long accused tech companies of being biased against conservatives.
The order targets current law — you may have heard recent references to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — that protects internet companies from lawsuits. They can’t be sued for hosting videos and posts from users, or for moderating their services, with some exceptions.
 
In its suit, the Center for Democracy and Technology said that Trump’s executive order violates the First Amendment because it attacks Twitter for putting the fact checks on the president’s tweets, which CDT said is Twitter’s right as a private company. More broadly, the order is trying to curb speech of all online platforms and people “by demonstrating the willingness to use government authority to retaliate against those who criticize the government,” CDT said.
“The government cannot and should not force online intermediaries into moderating speech according to the president’s whims,” said Alexandra Givens, CDT’s CEO, in an emailed statement. The organization filed the federal suit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.
 
There was pushback against Trump’s order from various sources. Tech industry groups, unsurprisingly, said it was bad for innovation and speech. Civil rights and libertarian organizations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also criticized Trump’s order.

"New Delhi: Getting unwarranted video call requests at odd hours and comments on social media photos by male colleagues who are not friends are among issues of sexual harassment women working from home during the nationwide lockdown have faced, organisations working against cyber harassment said.
The coronavirus-triggered lockdown has posed a lot of challenges for women professionals especially, as they struggle to manage the work-life balance. In addition, they are also facing sexual harassment online.
 
Many women have approached experts for guidance, unsure of how to raise complaints of sexual harassment in the work-from-home scenario.
“There are no clear guidelines from companies on how work from home should function in an organisation and that confuses women. I have been receiving 4-5 such complaints of harassment everyday ever since the lockdown was imposed,” said Akancha Srivastava, who runs the foundation Akancha Against Harassment, an initiative against cyber harassment.
However, the number of complaints received by the National Commission for Women (NCW) has been low since the lockdown began but those working in the field say that could be because many women do not want to officially complain but wish to consult what they can do on the matter.
 
“During the lockdown, many women are worried about their job security so they are not sure if they should speak up or not. The women have a constant worry that they should not be seen as troublemakers,” Srivastava said.
 “Since we have never experienced absolute work from home before, women are always second-guessing if it was harassment, where does one draw the line, how does one define the body language as offensive or indecent? Male colleagues stalking them on social media or sending friend requests, commenting on their pictures when they are not even friends.
 
“Women are being told to come online at odd hours. These are subtle ways of sexually harassing them,” she said.
Giving examples, Srivastava said one woman had recently received a video call request from her boss at 11 pm for an “urgent matter”, but when she received the call it turned out to be for something that on a regular day would have been easily taken care of over an email.
Srivastava said that with work-from-home, there are bound to be some disruptions and that colleagues should respectfully accept them, but that is not happening. That is causing more stress to women.
 
For example, in a sexist comment, another woman was asked by her boss over video call if she was capable of handling work assigned to her as she seemed “distracted” because of her children who were playing in the background.
Some women have also complained that they find their colleagues inappropriately dressed during virtual meetings and it made them uncomfortable.
The Prohibition of Sexual Harassment Act 2013 (or POSH) was enacted to ensure safe working spaces for women and to build enabling work environments that respect the rights of working women to equality of status and opportunity.
 
It defined a ‘workplace’ as “any place visited by employee arising out of or during the course of employment, including transportation provided by the employer for undertaking such a journey”. As such, while working from home, the home can also be defined as the workplace.
An activist at InfoSec Girls, an organisation educating women on cyber security, said a lot of people don’t report but wish to discuss what they should do when they face sexual harassment.
The activist said there have been times when men either do not realise that women colleagues are also on the call or choose to wilfully ignore it, while passing inappropriate comments.
 
Also, now that everyone is working from home, colleagues have lost sense of propriety about when a female colleague can be contacted. People end calling anytime and begin meetings at odd times. This can make women uncomfortable as they have to balance family life with work, she said.
“When women raise these kinds of concerns, we say, ‘if you feel uncomfortable with any discussion or comment, raise the concern immediately on the call so it does not happen again. If that makes them uncomfortable, then discuss it with the leadership or raise it via the organisation reporting channel’,” she said.
 
Every organisation is supposed to follow the Visakha guidelines on sexual harassment. “There is a proper council that addresses all these concerns. Women can anonymously report the concerns. The council then discusses the concern with person against whom the complaint was raised. If nothing else works out, women can report to local authorities,” she said.

"Tipplers in the five southern states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are eagerly awaiting the home delivery of alcohol as Zomato and Swiggy expanded the services launched in Jharkhand last week to Odisha today.
Less than a week after putting ‘wine shops’ in Jharkhand on its platform, Zomato expanded to Bhubaneswar and will soon deliver to other cities such as Rourkela, Balasore, Balangir, Sambalpur, Berhampur and Cuttack. Swiggy said it was starting with Bhubaneswar and Rourkela and would soon serve Cuttack and Berhampur as well.
 
The southward direction that the alcohol delivery services of the apps have taken bring hope to drinkers in the five southern states. While liquor outlets have opened in most places in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Kerala is still holding out.
The state, whose largest source of revenue is alcohol sales, has exercised restraint in opening up its state-owned Beverages Corporation (Bevco) outlets, cautious about triggering a setback to its successfully continuing fight against COVID-19, as people would inevitably crowd the wine shops.
 
To get around the problem, Kerala is launching its own Bevco app called Bev Q. Unlike Swiggy and Zomato that offer home delivery, Bev Q is a mobile virtual queue management app, which will enable the state to reopen liquor outlets while getting the public to adhere to physical distancing norms.
It has even passed the Google test, reports said, paving the way for the app to be listed for download on the Android Play Store.
Nevertheless tipplers would like the option of Swiggy and Zomato home delivery.
How a country coy about liquor allowed home delivery
 
After liquor shops across the country were shut down when the lockdown began on March 25,  as the restrictions were eased recently, the Supreme Court asked states to consider non-direct contact or online sales and home delivery of liquor during the lockdown period to prevent the spread of coronavirus on account of crowding at the shops.
Zomato and Swiggy, which already have a food delivery network in place across the country, then worked with state excise departments to work out the modalities of home delivery. To ensure compliance with safety guidelines as well as the laws on alcohol consumption, the two platforms verify the identity of the buyers to confirm they are not underage.
 
Users are required to upload a valid ID proof to order on the apps, which are later verified by delivery executives at the time of handing over the order. There would also be limits on how many bottles can be purchased, Zomato said.
Swiggy said it was partnering with authorised retailers after validating their licence and other required documents as outlined by the state government. It is also going one step further by getting customers to upload not just valid government ID but also a selfie, which the platform will use for authentication.
 
The company has partnered with HyperVerge to enable AI-face recognition for mandatory age verification and user authentication for alcohol deliveries, it said.

"Weeks after Mukesh Ambani signed a deal between JioMart and Facebook, the self-declared kirana store aggregator has launched its services in 200 cities, including small cities such as Bhatinda, Mysuru and Dehradun, but without taking the neighbourhood stores on board.
A pilot project launched last month in Navi Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan, all suburbs of Mumbai, included kirana stores as well as JioMart’s own warehouses; but now with the national launch, the kirana stores are nowhere in the picture at present.
 
Currently, grocery orders placed on the JioMart website are serviced by Reliance Smart and Fresh stores and Reliance Retail’s Sahakari Bhandar stores, not neighbourhood shops, PTI quoted the financial services company Credit Suisse as saying.
“Just prior to the national launch, Reliance Retail tapped the WhatsApp customer base in the three pilot regions to source orders. In our view, it was just a test phase of integration,” it said.
""The orders were available only for pick-up from nearby kirana stores, whose details were sent to the customer via WhatsApp. However, the national launch, so far, does not have that integration with WhatsApp.”
 
While JioMart claims it will be adding kirana stores shortly on its platform, the question arises whether this is just a test phase to see whether customers will flock to JioMart abandoning their neighbourhood stores.
Even if that is not the case or in the event that the test is not successful and the kirana stores just have to be brought on board, Reliance could use them as mere delivery mules, insisting that the stores stock what Reliance supplies, at the rate it decides.
In an indication of that, Credit Suisse said, “In terms of pricing, Reliance has extended the Smart promise of ‘minimum 5 per cent off on MRP’ to all products on JioMart. The discount is higher on its private label brands, and is competitive to branded products.”
 
So, if it looks like the kirana store aggregator model of JioMart is morphing into a takeover of the grocery market itself, it could very well be the case. Market research firm Bernstein says groceries make up 70 per cent of the Indian retail market, with more than 90 per cent driven by neighbourhood shops. “Organised penetration is less than 10 per cent while online penetration is less than 1 per cent,” it said.
So Reliance’s likely ambition to replace mom and pop stores is pretty much in keeping with what seems to be its monopolistic vision. Case in point, the telecom industry, where Reliance’s free offers and low prices managed to make it the dominant force in a field that earlier had several players.
 
As things stand, supermarket chain D-Mart’s April revenues are down 45 per cent year-on-year, with nearly 50 per cent of its stores shut or having restricted hours of operation. D-Mart is just one example among a vast space being vacated by similar businesses in the grocery market.
These falling revenues are what Reliance aims to mop up with the JioMart network.
“...a pan-India extension of partnerships with mom and pop stores after a successful beta test and ramp-up of this new commerce venture is crucial in Reliance’s grand plan of converting Jio’s 400 million-plus subscribers into customers for its ecommerce and other offerings,” market investment and insights firm CLSA was quoted as saying by PTI.
 
As such, Reliance’s recent partnership with Facebook-owned WhatsApp for JioMart is aimed at converting Jio subscribers into JioMart shoppers.
Eventually, like other online retailers, Reliance could integrate its entire retail offerings, including fashion, lifestyle and consumer electronics, onto one super ecommerce platform and mobile app, rivalling Amazon and Flipkart.
Bernstein in a separate report said as much: “JioMart has seen a 4x rise in online orders from a low base. With its pan India presence, JioMart now directly competes with Amazon and Flipkart in eCommerce.”

But it also means that people are constantly being watched by entities that can set the tone for public behaviour without giving a shred of consideration to people’s privacy. One of the greatest contemporary thinkers, Noam Chomsky, warns of the consequences of technology being allowed to control our lives in the guise of making our lives easier.
In an interview with AFP, Chomsky talked about how the dystopian reality of digital surveillance is already here.  “There are now companies developing technology which make it possible for the employer ... to look at what's on your computer screen and to check your keystrokes and if you get up and walk away for a minute, they'll send you a warning.”
 
“That's being installed right now.... It's not the future.”
The very things that are convenient are the ones that are invasive, he pointed out. “The so-called Internet of Things is coming along. It's convenient. It means if you're driving home you can turn on the stove — but it also means that that information is going to Google and Facebook, to the government, the American government, the French government, it's an enormous amount of potential control, surveillance and invasion. But this has happened. It's not the future.
 
“If we allow the huge tech companies, the state, to control our life that's what will happen. They'll turn it into something like China, where you have social credit systems and in some cities you get a certain amount of credits, there's face recognition technology all over the place and everything you do gets monitored.
“If you cross the street in the wrong place, you can ... lose some credits, and so on.
“It's not inevitable, just like global warming, that it's going to happen — unless people stop it.”
 
When asked whether the use of surveillance was justified in combating COVID-19, said “It might be — during the period of threat. There's controls needed during wartime, you have rationing. But it doesn't have to be permanent.... 'Yes, we'll let you have this authority now, but it can be revoked at any time.'""
Speaking about other major problems facing humankind, Chomsky said global warming was a greater threat than even the deadly pandemic. . “As severe as this pandemic is, it's not the worst problem. There will be recovery from the pandemic at severe cost ... but there isn't going to be any recovery from the melting of the polar ice caps and the rising of sea levels and the other deleterious effects of global warming,” he said.
 
However, it is evident that the public is either not aware or not bothered to see global warming as a serious enough problem.  
That kind of a public in the US also voted for a leadership that has proven itself wholly unequal to the task of managing the pandemic in the country where more than 100,000 people have died of it . “There's no coherent leadership. It's chaotic. The presidency, the White House, is in the hands of a sociopathic megalomaniac who's interested in nothing but his own power, electoral prospects — doesn't care what happens to the country, the world,” Chomsky said, in scathing criticism of President Donald Trump.
 
Chomsky spelled out how the administration under Trump never even gave the US a chance against COVID-19. “As soon as Trump came in, his first move was to dismantle the entire pandemic prevention machinery. At the start, defunding the Center for Disease Control, which would deal with this. And canceling programs that were working with Chinese scientists to identify potential viruses. So the US was singularly unprepared,” Chomsky said.
He explained the economic model that led to the current situation. “It's a privatised society, very wealthy, with enormous advantages — far more than any other country — but it’s in the stranglehold of private control.
 
“It doesn't have a universal health care system.... It's the ultimate neoliberal system, actually.”
He compared it to Europe, which in “many ways is worse, because the austerity programs just amplify the danger, because of the severe attack on democracy in Europe, the shifting decisions to Brussels....” But he added, “At least it has the residue of some kind of social democratic structure, which provides some support, which is what I think is lacking in the US.”

"Tipplers in the five southern states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are eagerly awaiting the home delivery of alcohol as Zomato and Swiggy expanded the services launched in Jharkhand last week to Odisha today.
Less than a week after putting ‘wine shops’ in Jharkhand on its platform, Zomato expanded to Bhubaneswar and will soon deliver to other cities such as Rourkela, Balasore, Balangir, Sambalpur, Berhampur and Cuttack. Swiggy said it was starting with Bhubaneswar and Rourkela and would soon serve Cuttack and Berhampur as well.
 
The southward direction that the alcohol delivery services of the apps have taken bring hope to drinkers in the five southern states. While liquor outlets have opened in most places in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Kerala is still holding out.
The state, whose largest source of revenue is alcohol sales, has exercised restraint in opening up its state-owned Beverages Corporation (Bevco) outlets, cautious about triggering a setback to its successfully continuing fight against COVID-19, as people would inevitably crowd the wine shops.
 
To get around the problem, Kerala is launching its own Bevco app called Bev Q. Unlike Swiggy and Zomato that offer home delivery, Bev Q is a mobile virtual queue management app, which will enable the state to reopen liquor outlets while getting the public to adhere to physical distancing norms.
It has even passed the Google test, reports said, paving the way for the app to be listed for download on the Android Play Store.
Nevertheless tipplers would like the option of Swiggy and Zomato home delivery.
How a country coy about liquor allowed home delivery
 
After liquor shops across the country were shut down when the lockdown began on March 25,  as the restrictions were eased recently, the Supreme Court asked states to consider non-direct contact or online sales and home delivery of liquor during the lockdown period to prevent the spread of coronavirus on account of crowding at the shops.
Zomato and Swiggy, which already have a food delivery network in place across the country, then worked with state excise departments to work out the modalities of home delivery. To ensure compliance with safety guidelines as well as the laws on alcohol consumption, the two platforms verify the identity of the buyers to confirm they are not underage.
 
Users are required to upload a valid ID proof to order on the apps, which are later verified by delivery executives at the time of handing over the order. There would also be limits on how many bottles can be purchased, Zomato said.
Swiggy said it was partnering with authorised retailers after validating their licence and other required documents as outlined by the state government. It is also going one step further by getting customers to upload not just valid government ID but also a selfie, which the platform will use for authentication.
 
The company has partnered with HyperVerge to enable AI-face recognition for mandatory age verification and user authentication for alcohol deliveries, it said.

"This is a piece about a piece I didn’t want to write. And, subsequently, how I wrote about why I didn’t want to write it. On FB. And how that proved I was right in not writing it in the first place. No, I am not Swami Nithyananda writing pseudonymously from Shrikailasa and teleporting this piece to Asian Age via soooperconshussnessss. (Though I do think there is something to the depth of the physics being equal to the length of the geography.) Hear me out.
Just a while ago, a leading vernacular newspaper asked me if I could write a piece on someone I’m related to. A piece about what it was like growing up under his gaze, that kind of thing.
 
The following day, I apologized to them saying I would have to decline. The editor asked me why. I said it seemed unfair on my part to celebrate this person in this manner at a time like this.
She said she understood. But I don't know if she did. She couldn’t possibly have seen the italics in my response. The reason I declined was not because I thought the person was unworthy of celebration. Or that it was inappropriate on my part to celebrate him now.
It was more to do with how we ought to celebrate anyone or anything at all in these times. And by ‘we’, I mean the privileged.
 
Had I written purely about what he was mainly known for, no one would have faulted me. His work is formidable and relevant.
Not enough people knew that he had another side to him, too: social reformer. And that he had defied convention and community, and fought for the rights of, well, let’s just say, the downtrodden.
The right kind of stuff to recall and celebrate, you’d think, when our country’s rich, selfish and entitled are putting up recipes, work-out videos, and sari challenges as the poorest of the poor are dying in ways we can’t imagine.
 
But I still didn't think it was appropriate to write about him.
By writing in a newspaper, something only the privileged (and by that I mean anyone who has footwear, whose three meals a day are assured, has a roof over his head and won’t die of starvation anytime soon) have access to, or can afford, for that matter, I wondered what I would have achieved.
Would I have disturbed the comfortable, as they drank their second dose of filter coffee, paper in hand, their biggest worry being why their bm wasn’t entirely satisfactory? Would I have comforted the disturbed? Not a chance. Which hungry soul’s calloused feet would my piece have applied balm to?
 
Would the man himself be writing were he around now? I think not. He would be out there doing something.
Within minutes of my posting this, predictably, a cloth-bag-brandishing intellectual, the kind that doesn’t normally grace downmarket dives like my page, swooped in.
“Sorry Krishna,” he expounded. (His ilk never just say, they expound, explicate and expatiate.) “I don't buy this writing vs doing dichotomy. That's lazy theorizing. Sometimes, writing is doing. We certainly need to celebrate writers like this relative of yours. The unslippered anyway take comfort in songs while they trudge along the highways, and who knows one of those songs could be his.”
 
These are the actual words of the gent. And I use that term loosely.
He referred to the guest workers as the unslippered. And he actually believed the guest workers, currently dying on railway tracks and in road accidents if hunger, thirst, heat, exhaustion or plain despair hadn’t got to them already, needed songs, ditties and stand-up comedy, perhaps. And poets, writers, composers, filmmakers should busy themselves making inspirational art to save them, soothe them, as the disaster is still ongoing. Because painting, writing and sculpting were doing, too. Why give them rice, dal and water, was his point, when we could give them life-affirming art and literature.
 
It was as if Nero and Marie Antoinette had had a love child.
It’s not the casual callousness of the ones we dismiss as philistines that we need to worry about. It is the pathological lack of empathy on the part of the so-called intellectual class, the lot that has appointed itself caretaker and curator of art and literature, that frightens me.
The funny thing, by which I mean sad, is despite my FB post being about our appalling lack of empathy, even the ‘positive’ responses, from 95% of the folks, were about this relation of mine.
 
All isn’t lost, though. Saw another post on FB, that of a mother congratulating her daughter on her graduation. ‘Hope the future is full of happy surprises, baby girl,’ she said. ‘Waiting to celebrate once the world heals.’

"Weeks after Mukesh Ambani signed a deal between JioMart and Facebook, the self-declared kirana store aggregator has launched its services in 200 cities, including small cities such as Bhatinda, Mysuru and Dehradun, but without taking the neighbourhood stores on board.
A pilot project launched last month in Navi Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan, all suburbs of Mumbai, included kirana stores as well as JioMart’s own warehouses; but now with the national launch, the kirana stores are nowhere in the picture at present.
 
Currently, grocery orders placed on the JioMart website are serviced by Reliance Smart and Fresh stores and Reliance Retail’s Sahakari Bhandar stores, not neighbourhood shops, PTI quoted the financial services company Credit Suisse as saying.
“Just prior to the national launch, Reliance Retail tapped the WhatsApp customer base in the three pilot regions to source orders. In our view, it was just a test phase of integration,” it said.
""The orders were available only for pick-up from nearby kirana stores, whose details were sent to the customer via WhatsApp. However, the national launch, so far, does not have that integration with WhatsApp.”
 
While JioMart claims it will be adding kirana stores shortly on its platform, the question arises whether this is just a test phase to see whether customers will flock to JioMart abandoning their neighbourhood stores.
Even if that is not the case or in the event that the test is not successful and the kirana stores just have to be brought on board, Reliance could use them as mere delivery mules, insisting that the stores stock what Reliance supplies, at the rate it decides.
In an indication of that, Credit Suisse said, “In terms of pricing, Reliance has extended the Smart promise of ‘minimum 5 per cent off on MRP’ to all products on JioMart. The discount is higher on its private label brands, and is competitive to branded products.”
 
So, if it looks like the kirana store aggregator model of JioMart is morphing into a takeover of the grocery market itself, it could very well be the case. Market research firm Bernstein says groceries make up 70 per cent of the Indian retail market, with more than 90 per cent driven by neighbourhood shops. “Organised penetration is less than 10 per cent while online penetration is less than 1 per cent,” it said.
So Reliance’s likely ambition to replace mom and pop stores is pretty much in keeping with what seems to be its monopolistic vision. Case in point, the telecom industry, where Reliance’s free offers and low prices managed to make it the dominant force in a field that earlier had several players.
 
As things stand, supermarket chain D-Mart’s April revenues are down 45 per cent year-on-year, with nearly 50 per cent of its stores shut or having restricted hours of operation. D-Mart is just one example among a vast space being vacated by similar businesses in the grocery market.
These falling revenues are what Reliance aims to mop up with the JioMart network.
“...a pan-India extension of partnerships with mom and pop stores after a successful beta test and ramp-up of this new commerce venture is crucial in Reliance’s grand plan of converting Jio’s 400 million-plus subscribers into customers for its ecommerce and other offerings,” market investment and insights firm CLSA was quoted as saying by PTI.
 
As such, Reliance’s recent partnership with Facebook-owned WhatsApp for JioMart is aimed at converting Jio subscribers into JioMart shoppers.
Eventually, like other online retailers, Reliance could integrate its entire retail offerings, including fashion, lifestyle and consumer electronics, onto one super ecommerce platform and mobile app, rivalling Amazon and Flipkart.
Bernstein in a separate report said as much: “JioMart has seen a 4x rise in online orders from a low base. With its pan India presence, JioMart now directly competes with Amazon and Flipkart in eCommerce.”

"Washington: A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a legislation in both the chambers of the US Congress proposing major reforms in skilled non-immigrant visa programmes by giving priority to US-educated foreign technology professionals in issuing H-1B work visas.
The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act, as introduced in House of Representatives and Senate, will require US Citizenship and Immigration Services to prioritise for the first time the annual allocation of H-1B visas.
 
The new system would ensure that the best and brightest students being educated in the United States receive preference for an H-1B visa, including advanced degree holders, those being paid a high wage, and those with valuable skills, proponents of this major legislative reforms said Friday.
In the Senate, it was introduced by Senators Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin. In the House of Representatives, it was introduced by Congressmen Bill Pascrell, Paul Gosar, Ro Khanna, Frank Pallone and Lance Gooden.
The legislation reinstates Congress's original intent in the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes by increasing enforcement, modifying wage requirements and securing protections for both American workers and visa holders, the lawmakers said.
 
The legislation, among other things, explicitly prohibits the replacement of American workers by H-1B or L-1 visa holders, clarifying that working conditions of similarly employed American workers may not be adversely affected by the hiring of an H-1B worker, including H-1B workers who have been placed by another employer at the American worker's worksite.
These provisions address the types of abuses that have been well-documented.
Importantly, the legislation proposes increased crackdown on outsourcing companies that import large numbers of H-1B and L-1 workers for temporary training purposes only to send the workers back to their home countries to do the same job.
 
Specifically, the bill would prohibit companies with more than 50 employees, of which at least half are H-1B or L-1 holders, from hiring additional H-1B employees.
The bill gives the US Department of Labor enhanced authority to review, investigate, and audit employer compliance with programme requirements, as well as to penalise fraudulent or abusive conduct. It requires the production of extensive statistical data about the H-1B and L-1 programs, including wage data, worker education levels, place of employment, and gender.
In addition, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act encompasses several reforms of the L-1 visa programme, including establishment of a wage floor for L-1 workers; authority for the US Department of Homeland Security to investigate, audit, and enforce compliance with L-1 program requirements; assurance that intra-company transfers occur between legitimate branches of a company and don't involve  shell  facilities; and a change to the definition of  specialized knowledge  to ensure that L-1 visas are reserved only for truly key personnel.
 
Asserting that Congress created these programmes to complement America's high-skilled workforce, not replace it, Grassley said that unfortunately, some companies are trying to exploit the programmes by cutting American workers for cheaper labour.
“We need programmes dedicated to putting American workers first. When skilled foreign workers are needed to meet the demands of our labour market, we must also ensure that visa applicants who honed their skills at American colleges and universities are a priority over the importation of more foreign workers. Our bill takes steps to ensure that the programs work for Americans and skilled foreign workers alike,” he said.
 
Reforming the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes is a critical component of fixing the broken immigration system. For years, outsourcing companies have used loopholes in the laws to displace qualified American workers and facilitate the outsourcing of American jobs, Durbin said.
This legislation would end these abuses and protect American and foreign workers from exploitation, Durbin said.
Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna said that American immigrants come to this country with some of the most innovative, transformative ideas this world has ever seen.
 
""If we're going to continue to foster a culture of creativity, we must reform the H-1 and L-1 visa programmes to protect all workers from abuses. Immigrants coming here on H-1B visas have made important contributions to Silicon Valley's leadership in the digital revolution. We want to make sure that talent is coming to the US, but we also want to make sure that it's being done with proper compensation, Khanna said.
Congressman Pallone said that the US must ensure that qualified American workers have access to job opportunities in this country.

"Singapore: Singapore was criticised for being “cruel and inhumane” Wednesday after a death sentence was handed down via video-conferencing platform Zoom.
Malaysian drug trafficker Punithan Genasan was Friday sentenced to hang in a hearing conducted remotely due to restrictions in place to combat the spread of the coronavirus, court officials said.
 
The 37-year-old had been found guilty over the trafficking of at least 28.5 grams (1.0 ounce) of heroin, a crime punishable by death under the city-state’s tough anti-drugs laws.
The Supreme Court said that it was the first criminal case where a death sentence was handed down in a remote hearing.
Zoom has become popular during virus lockdowns worldwide for everything from virtual school classes to business meetings—but Human Rights Watch criticised its use to mete out capital punishment.
“The death penalty is inherently cruel and inhumane, and Singapore’s use of remote technology like Zoom to sentence a man to death makes it even more so,” said the group’s deputy Asia director Phil Robertson.
 
“It’s pretty astounding the prosecutors and the court are so callous that they fail to see that a man facing capital punishment should have the right to be present in court to see his accusers,” he told AFP.
The Supreme Court said that the hearing was conducted remotely “for the safety of all involved in the proceedings”.
Singapore maintains that the death penalty—a legacy of British colonial rule—is necessary as a deterrent against crime although rights groups have long called for it to be abolished.

"On April 1, a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emailed Nevada public health counterparts for lab reports on two travelers who had tested positive for the coronavirus. She asked Nevada to send those records via a secure network or a “password protected encrypted file” to protect the travelers’ privacy.
The Nevada response: Can we just fax them over?
 
You’d hardly know the U.S. invented the internet by the way its public health workers are collecting vital pandemic data. While health-care industry record-keeping is now mostly electronic, cash-strapped state and local health departments still rely heavily on faxes, email and spreadsheets to gather infectious disease data and share it with federal authorities.
This data dysfunction is hamstringing the nation’s coronavirus response by, among other things, slowing the tracing of people potentially exposed to the virus. In response, the Trump administration set up a parallel reporting system run by the Silicon Valley data-wrangling firm Palantir. Duplicating many data requests, it has placed new burdens on front-line workers at hospitals, labs and other health care centers who already report case and testing data to public health agencies.
 
There’s little evidence so far that the Palantir system has measurably improved federal or state response to COVID-19.
Emails exchanged between the CDC and Nevada officials in March and early April, obtained by The Associated Press in a public records request, illustrate the scope of the problem. It sometimes takes multiple days to track down such basic information as patient addresses and phone numbers. One disease detective consults Google to fill a gap. Data vital to case investigations such as patient travel and medical histories is missing.
 
None of this is news to the CDC or other health experts. “We are woefully behind,” the CDC’s No. 2 official, Anne Schuchat, wrote in a September report on public health data technology. She likened the state of U.S. public health technology to “puttering along the data superhighway in our Model T Ford.”
Holes in the data
This information technology gap might seem puzzling given that most hospitals and other health care providers have long since ditched paper files for electronic health records. Inside the industry, they’re easily shared, often automatically.
 
But data collection for infectious-disease reports is another story, particularly in comparison to other industrialized nations. Countries like Germany, Britain and South Korea _ and U.S. states such as New York and Colorado _ are able to populate online dashboards far richer in real-time data and analysis. In Germany, a map populated with public data gathered by an emergency-care doctors’ association even shows hospital bed availability.
In the U.S., many hospitals and doctors are often failing to report detailed clinical data on coronavirus cases, largely because it would have to be manually extracted from electronic records, then sent by fax or email, said Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo.
 
It’s not unusual for public health workers to have to track patients down on social media, use the phone book or scavenge through other public-health databases that may have that information, said Rachelle Boulton, the Utah health department official responsible for epidemiological reporting. Even when hospitals and labs report that information electronically, it’s often incomplete.
Deficiencies in CDC collection have been especially glaring.
In 75% of COVID-19 cases compiled in April, data on the race and ethnicity of victims was missing. A report on children affected by the virus only had symptom data for 9%of laboratory-confirmed cases for which age was known. A study on virus-stricken U.S. health care workers could not tally the number affected because the applicable boxes were only checked on 16% of received case forms. In another study, the CDC only had data on preexisting conditions _ risk factors such as diabetes, heart and respiratory disease _ for 6% of reported cases.
 
Missing from daily indicators that CDC makes public is data such as nationwide hospitalizations over the previous 24 hours and numbers of tests ordered and completed _ information vital to guiding the federal response, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.
“The CDC during this entire pandemic has been two steps behind the disease,” Jha said.
Reinventing the wheel
Instead of accelerating existing efforts to modernize U.S. disease reporting, the White House asked Palantir, whose founder Peter Thiel is a major backer of President Donald Trump, to hastily build out a data collection platform called HHS Protect. It has not gone well.
 
On March 29, Vice President Mike Pence, who chairs the task force, sent a letter asking 4,700 hospitals to collect daily numbers on virus test results, patient loads and hospital bed and intensive care-unit capacity. That information, the letter said, should be compiled into spreadsheets and emailed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would feed it into the $25 million Palantir system.
On April 10, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar added more reporting requirements for hospitals.
Those mandates sparked a backlash among stressed hospitals already reporting data to state and local health departments. Producing additional cumbersome spreadsheets for the federal government “is just not sustainable,” said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.
 
HHS Protect now comprises more than 200 datasets, including reporting from nearly three-quarters of the roughly 8,000 U.S. hospitals, according to Katie McKeogh, an HHS press officer. It includes supply-chain data from industry, test results from labs and state policy actions.
But due to limited government transparency, it’s not clear how accurate or helpful HHS Protect has been. Asked for examples of its usefulness, McKeogh mentioned only one: White House task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx receives a nightly report based on what the system gathers that provides “a common (nationwide) operating picture of cases at a county level.”
 
“We will continue to work to improve upon the common operating picture,” McKeogh said when asked about holes in HHS data collection. Neither HHS nor the CDC would provide officials to answer questions about HHS Protect; Palantir declined to discuss it on the record.
Fixing the problem
Farzad Mostashari, who a decade ago oversaw the federal effort to modernize paper-based medical records, said it would be far more efficient to fix existing public-health data systems than to create a parallel system like HHS Protect.
“We have a lot of the pieces in place,” Mostashari said. A public-private partnership called digitalbridge.us is central to that effort. Pilot projects that automate infectious disease case reporting were expanded in late January. Overall, 252,000 COVID case reports have been generated so far, said CDC spokesman Benjamin N. Haynes. In December, Congress appropriated $50 million for grants to expand the effort, which is already active in Utah, New York, California, Texas and Michigan.
 
Going forward, the CDC is evaluating how to spend $500 million from March’s huge pandemic relief package to upgrade health care information technology.
In the meantime, public-health officers are still doing things the hard way. Up to half the lab reports submitted for public health case investigations lack patient addresses or ZIP codes, according to a May 1 Duke University white paper co-authored by Mostashari.
“We’re losing days trying to go back and collect that information,” said Hamilton of the epidemiologists’ council. “And then we’re reaching out to hospitals or physicians’ offices that, quite frankly, are saying ‘I’m too busy to tell you that.””

"Washington: A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a legislation in both the chambers of the US Congress proposing major reforms in skilled non-immigrant visa programmes by giving priority to US-educated foreign technology professionals in issuing H-1B work visas.
The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act, as introduced in House of Representatives and Senate, will require US Citizenship and Immigration Services to prioritise for the first time the annual allocation of H-1B visas.
 
The new system would ensure that the best and brightest students being educated in the United States receive preference for an H-1B visa, including advanced degree holders, those being paid a high wage, and those with valuable skills, proponents of this major legislative reforms said Friday.
In the Senate, it was introduced by Senators Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin. In the House of Representatives, it was introduced by Congressmen Bill Pascrell, Paul Gosar, Ro Khanna, Frank Pallone and Lance Gooden.
The legislation reinstates Congress's original intent in the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes by increasing enforcement, modifying wage requirements and securing protections for both American workers and visa holders, the lawmakers said.
 
The legislation, among other things, explicitly prohibits the replacement of American workers by H-1B or L-1 visa holders, clarifying that working conditions of similarly employed American workers may not be adversely affected by the hiring of an H-1B worker, including H-1B workers who have been placed by another employer at the American worker's worksite.
These provisions address the types of abuses that have been well-documented.
Importantly, the legislation proposes increased crackdown on outsourcing companies that import large numbers of H-1B and L-1 workers for temporary training purposes only to send the workers back to their home countries to do the same job.
 
Specifically, the bill would prohibit companies with more than 50 employees, of which at least half are H-1B or L-1 holders, from hiring additional H-1B employees.
The bill gives the US Department of Labor enhanced authority to review, investigate, and audit employer compliance with programme requirements, as well as to penalise fraudulent or abusive conduct. It requires the production of extensive statistical data about the H-1B and L-1 programs, including wage data, worker education levels, place of employment, and gender.
In addition, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act encompasses several reforms of the L-1 visa programme, including establishment of a wage floor for L-1 workers; authority for the US Department of Homeland Security to investigate, audit, and enforce compliance with L-1 program requirements; assurance that intra-company transfers occur between legitimate branches of a company and don't involve  shell  facilities; and a change to the definition of  specialized knowledge  to ensure that L-1 visas are reserved only for truly key personnel.
 
Asserting that Congress created these programmes to complement America's high-skilled workforce, not replace it, Grassley said that unfortunately, some companies are trying to exploit the programmes by cutting American workers for cheaper labour.
“We need programmes dedicated to putting American workers first. When skilled foreign workers are needed to meet the demands of our labour market, we must also ensure that visa applicants who honed their skills at American colleges and universities are a priority over the importation of more foreign workers. Our bill takes steps to ensure that the programs work for Americans and skilled foreign workers alike,” he said.
 
Reforming the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes is a critical component of fixing the broken immigration system. For years, outsourcing companies have used loopholes in the laws to displace qualified American workers and facilitate the outsourcing of American jobs, Durbin said.
This legislation would end these abuses and protect American and foreign workers from exploitation, Durbin said.
Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna said that American immigrants come to this country with some of the most innovative, transformative ideas this world has ever seen.
 
""If we're going to continue to foster a culture of creativity, we must reform the H-1 and L-1 visa programmes to protect all workers from abuses. Immigrants coming here on H-1B visas have made important contributions to Silicon Valley's leadership in the digital revolution. We want to make sure that talent is coming to the US, but we also want to make sure that it's being done with proper compensation, Khanna said.
Congressman Pallone said that the US must ensure that qualified American workers have access to job opportunities in this country.

"New York: With concerts on hold to halt coronavirus spread, the gaming world is increasingly catering to music lovers, with artists becoming animated performers in virtual realms to the trippy delight of millions.
The trend has gained momentum in recent weeks after the ultra-popular Fortnite morphed rapper Travis Scott into a massive psychedelic spaceman performing in a celestial dreamscape, as a record-setting 12.3 million concurrent players entered his 10-minute set inside the game.
 
According to the platform that’s spurred an international gaming craze since launching in 2017, over 27.7 million unique players participated in the Scott show across its premiere and four encore presentations.
And in early May Fortnite launched an enormous virtual party featuring DJs including deadmau5 and Steve Aoki, celebrating its milestone of 350 million registered players.
The pandemic didn’t prompt transforming artists into avatars—DJ Marshmello had a massive Fortnite concert in 2019 -- but that much of the globe’s population has been urged or forced to stay home over COVID-19 has certainly spotlighted it.
 
Acknowledging the unfortunate circumstances coronavirus has wrought more broadly, Adam Arrigo—the CEO of Wave, an entertainment technology company that has put on concerts from DJ Jean-Michel Jarre and now is teaming with artists including R&B singer John Legend—said virtual show business “has exploded” due to quarantine measures.
“It’s kind of given us a chance to show people really what the value, both creatively and economically, of virtual concerts is,” said Arrigo, who co-founded Wave in 2016.
 
‘Visual spectacle’
Virtual concerts in Fortnite or on other gaming platforms, as well as streaming outlets like YouTube live or Twitch, are a different, much more elaborate animal than the concerts many stars have launched recently on Instagram or Facebook live apps.
A musician himself, Arrigo told AFP the virtual experience intends to take viewers “where I can be any avatar I want, or the performer can take me on a journey—just like I feel when I go to a physical show.”
 “You’re not beholden to the laws of physics or gravity, so you can just do anything,” the 36-year-old said.
 
These types of shows see performers transformed into an avatar that uses computer vision and motion capture technology to mimic the artist’s live movements in real-time—“when they smile, their avatar smiles,” explained Arrigo.
Pandemic rush              
The pandemic is an ideal moment to market: Most game developers “are treating this period the way that they would look at traditionally fruitful market periods,” said Dmitri Williams, a communications and technology scholar at the University of Southern California.
 
Arrigo holds that virtual concerts can offer a way forward to bolster the industry, a “complement” to live performances, once they return, for fans to enjoy and artists to earn income from.
For now, income streams include ways to make the virtual concert experience “VIP”—buying virtual goods for your avatar, or sending a performer onstage flowers in the hopes they’ll interact with you.
Ticketed streams at different price points are also an option to up revenue, said Arrigo.

"Singapore: Singapore was criticised for being “cruel and inhumane” Wednesday after a death sentence was handed down via video-conferencing platform Zoom.
Malaysian drug trafficker Punithan Genasan was Friday sentenced to hang in a hearing conducted remotely due to restrictions in place to combat the spread of the coronavirus, court officials said.
 
The 37-year-old had been found guilty over the trafficking of at least 28.5 grams (1.0 ounce) of heroin, a crime punishable by death under the city-state’s tough anti-drugs laws.
The Supreme Court said that it was the first criminal case where a death sentence was handed down in a remote hearing.
Zoom has become popular during virus lockdowns worldwide for everything from virtual school classes to business meetings—but Human Rights Watch criticised its use to mete out capital punishment.
“The death penalty is inherently cruel and inhumane, and Singapore’s use of remote technology like Zoom to sentence a man to death makes it even more so,” said the group’s deputy Asia director Phil Robertson.
 
“It’s pretty astounding the prosecutors and the court are so callous that they fail to see that a man facing capital punishment should have the right to be present in court to see his accusers,” he told AFP.
The Supreme Court said that the hearing was conducted remotely “for the safety of all involved in the proceedings”.
Singapore maintains that the death penalty—a legacy of British colonial rule—is necessary as a deterrent against crime although rights groups have long called for it to be abolished.

"In the fight to halt the coronavirus, several countries have been touted as models to be emulated. Chiefly, South Korea is oft cited, justifiably so. However, no country has met with as much success in holding off and beating back the virus as Taiwan, whose geographical and cultural proximity, literally next door, to China makes the feat all the more remarkable. Contained in this narrative are valuable insights for other countries such as India that are still in the throes of this pandemic.
Situated a mere 130 km off the coast of mainland China, Taiwan has 850,000 to 1 million citizens who live or work in China. Although Beijing and Taipei are adversarial regimes, numerous daily flights link the island to multiple major cities in China. Given such proximity, Taiwan would likely be the most affected by any epidemic with origins in China. In fact, it was the hardest hit when SARS broke out in China in 2003. Taiwan then had the highest mortality rate in the world.
 
That did not happen this time.
Taiwan's Covid-19 numbers have been surprisingly low, for a country that has 2.7 million visitors from the mainland annually and almost 12,000 daily just before the Lunar New Year. As of May 12, Taiwan has 440 total coronavirus cases, of which 372 have already been cured. There have been only 7 deaths. With less than 100 active cases, Taiwan has halted the virus at its doorstep. It managed all this in spite of not being a member of the WHO and while organising a national election on January 11.
How was this possible?
 
Led by Experts
Remarkably, Taiwan’s strategy to combat the novel coronavirus nCoV19 was led by experts and scientists who responded with urgency to the initial outbreak in China. Taiwan’s vice-president, Chen Chien-jen is a Johns Hopkins University trained epidemiologist, public health expert and national hero for his role as health minister during the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Similarly, vice-premier Chen Chi-mai is a physician by training and former lecturer who collaborated with Minister for health and welfare Chen Shih-chung, a doctor and former director of Taipei Medical University. According to Channel News Asia (CNA), at 8 A.M on December 31, the latter was informed of at least seven atypical cases of pneumonia in Wuhan. Within an hour an inter-ministerial meeting was held to determine the measures to be taken to tackle the virus. 
 
This response was as agile as the response in Wuhan itself. Over the next few days, suspected-case reporting and hospital infection control measures were strengthened, a level-1 travel notice to Wuhan was announced, and by January 15 all hospitals and the public were notified about the emerging infectious disease. By January 20, Taiwan activated the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) to coordinate and lead the response to the virus. Daily briefings to the public conducted by health minister Chen Shih-chung, attended by nearly 100,000 people, were also important in keeping the public informed and aware. The health minister currently enjoys an approval rating of 91% in Taiwan and has become the country’s most popular politician, even more than President Tsai ing-wen.
 
Flight Screening and Border Controls
Allowing public health experts to direct the response to Covid-19 meant that Taiwan could make a crucial connection very very early: that air travel was the main pathway of virus transmission. So, Taipei acted quickly to restrict and monitor air travel.
On December 31, the very day China reported the outbreak to the WHO, Taiwan began sending healthcare officials into airplanes to check passengers arriving from Wuhan before they disembarked. Within a couple of days, these measures were expanded to include fever screening and full-scale medical examination of suspected cases. Within 10 days after the flareup of the mysterious new virus in Wuhan on January 21, Taiwan closed its borders to all Wuhan residents, and by 6 Feb extended the restrictions to all arrivals from China, six days before any other country did so. Taiwan also issued a ban on all port calls by international cruise ships on Feb 6, to prevent more cases like the Diamond Princess. To monitor all foreign arrivals into the country, passengers were required to sign and complete a health declaration form. As the virus began to spread outside China to places like Thailand and Singapore, travel advisories were issued to these places by February 11. By early March, all foreign arrivals without a residence permit were banned from entering the country.
 
By strange coincidence or premonition, nearly a fortnight before December 31,
on December 18, 2019, in fact, an awards ceremony was held in Taiwan for airlines with outstanding performance in disease surveillance and aviation safety. At the same event, Taiwan CDC, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced their joint collaboration in implementing the Program for Airlines on Disease Prevention, Preparedness and Response, and Emergency Management, the first of its kind in the world. 
 
Central Command Coordinated Measures
Activated on January 20, the Central Epidemic Command Centre proceeded to implement a total of 124 measures so far, including but not limited to border controls and fever screenings. One of the most significant of these was, contrary to WHO advice, a ban on the export of face masks and a decision to increase the production of protective equipment. The ban came into effect on Jan 24, one month before any other country adopted the same measure. According to the Vice-President, by the end of January, Taiwan stockpiled 44 million surgical masks, 1.95 million N-95 masks and 1,100 negative pressure isolation rooms. A national mask team was set up and 92 additional production lines were installed and the government requisitioned a total of 73 manufacturing companies. The policy increased the average daily production of masks from 1.9 million in January to 16 million masks daily in April. The CECC also instituted a rationing system for masks, according to which every citizen could buy 3 masks per week, then raised to 9 every fortnight, and finally an online ordering system was instituted.
 
Taiwan’s lightning-quick reaction has undoubtedly saved hundreds of lives and prevented thousands more from becoming infected. The island managed this without ever announcing a lockdown and significantly disrupting domestic economic and social life. Taiwan is also able to avoid, to a certain extent, the economic slump that follows a lockdown. Agencies like S&P and other economists have revised Taiwan’s GDP for 2020, but by a smaller margin than any other industrialised country. Schools, offices, restaurants and malls have remained open through the outbreak, limiting the disruption to the economy. Additionally, the island’s approach of involving the public in the fight against Covid-19 has the additional benefit of inculcating awareness in its public, making a transition to the new normal much smoother. With just 65 active cases left, Taiwan has turned its attention to other countries struggling to contain the virus, with the campaign TaiwanCanHelp, which donates masks and other resources.
 
Most of Taiwan’s measures to combat Covid-19 were announced in late January and early February, taking effect almost immediately. The credit for this accrues to experts and scientists holding political office, who lead the fight against Covid-19, calling the shots and responding to developments in China almost instantaneously. The promptness in enacting these measures has been shown by no other country. While some countries like India were busy hosting grand bilateral summits for foreign leaders and others like USA were turning the virus into a political weapon, Taiwan was preparing for the Covid-19 outbreak, which has held the country in good stead in the months following the initial stages of the outbreak.

"On April 1, a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emailed Nevada public health counterparts for lab reports on two travelers who had tested positive for the coronavirus. She asked Nevada to send those records via a secure network or a “password protected encrypted file” to protect the travelers’ privacy.
The Nevada response: Can we just fax them over?
 
You’d hardly know the U.S. invented the internet by the way its public health workers are collecting vital pandemic data. While health-care industry record-keeping is now mostly electronic, cash-strapped state and local health departments still rely heavily on faxes, email and spreadsheets to gather infectious disease data and share it with federal authorities.
This data dysfunction is hamstringing the nation’s coronavirus response by, among other things, slowing the tracing of people potentially exposed to the virus. In response, the Trump administration set up a parallel reporting system run by the Silicon Valley data-wrangling firm Palantir. Duplicating many data requests, it has placed new burdens on front-line workers at hospitals, labs and other health care centers who already report case and testing data to public health agencies.
 
There’s little evidence so far that the Palantir system has measurably improved federal or state response to COVID-19.
Emails exchanged between the CDC and Nevada officials in March and early April, obtained by The Associated Press in a public records request, illustrate the scope of the problem. It sometimes takes multiple days to track down such basic information as patient addresses and phone numbers. One disease detective consults Google to fill a gap. Data vital to case investigations such as patient travel and medical histories is missing.
 
None of this is news to the CDC or other health experts. “We are woefully behind,” the CDC’s No. 2 official, Anne Schuchat, wrote in a September report on public health data technology. She likened the state of U.S. public health technology to “puttering along the data superhighway in our Model T Ford.”
Holes in the data
This information technology gap might seem puzzling given that most hospitals and other health care providers have long since ditched paper files for electronic health records. Inside the industry, they’re easily shared, often automatically.
 
But data collection for infectious-disease reports is another story, particularly in comparison to other industrialized nations. Countries like Germany, Britain and South Korea _ and U.S. states such as New York and Colorado _ are able to populate online dashboards far richer in real-time data and analysis. In Germany, a map populated with public data gathered by an emergency-care doctors’ association even shows hospital bed availability.
In the U.S., many hospitals and doctors are often failing to report detailed clinical data on coronavirus cases, largely because it would have to be manually extracted from electronic records, then sent by fax or email, said Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo.
 
It’s not unusual for public health workers to have to track patients down on social media, use the phone book or scavenge through other public-health databases that may have that information, said Rachelle Boulton, the Utah health department official responsible for epidemiological reporting. Even when hospitals and labs report that information electronically, it’s often incomplete.
Deficiencies in CDC collection have been especially glaring.
In 75% of COVID-19 cases compiled in April, data on the race and ethnicity of victims was missing. A report on children affected by the virus only had symptom data for 9%of laboratory-confirmed cases for which age was known. A study on virus-stricken U.S. health care workers could not tally the number affected because the applicable boxes were only checked on 16% of received case forms. In another study, the CDC only had data on preexisting conditions _ risk factors such as diabetes, heart and respiratory disease _ for 6% of reported cases.
 
Missing from daily indicators that CDC makes public is data such as nationwide hospitalizations over the previous 24 hours and numbers of tests ordered and completed _ information vital to guiding the federal response, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.
“The CDC during this entire pandemic has been two steps behind the disease,” Jha said.
Reinventing the wheel
Instead of accelerating existing efforts to modernize U.S. disease reporting, the White House asked Palantir, whose founder Peter Thiel is a major backer of President Donald Trump, to hastily build out a data collection platform called HHS Protect. It has not gone well.

"Khammam: He waited 40 days as the lockdown kept getting extended, and when the special trains were announced it seemed like a ray of hope. But his village was nowhere near the train routes decided by the Centre. So 25-year-old Kasa Madakami and other migrant labourers began a 500-km walk from Hyderabad to Pandripani village in Malkangiri district in Odisha. After four days in the scorching heat, his journey ended abruptly in Bhadrachalam where he collapsed and died.
Madakami had been employed as a construction worker in Hyderabad. For him and his companions there was no hope left in the city after all the construction work had stopped. The only thing left to do was to go home to their families in their native villages, where everybody knew their names, where somebody cared for them.
 
It was just four days ago, after 40 days of being unemployed and stranded that they decided to start walking, with no hope of getting any government arranged means of transport. Left to their own means, they did not carry enough water and food with for the journey, Madakam Naresh, Madakami’s co-traveller, said.
Walking an average of 80 km a day, they had covered a distance of 320 km and reached Bhadrachalam in 40-degree Celsius heat on Tuesday.
All of a sudden, Madakami collapsed.
He was immediately taken to a hospital but doctors declared him dead on arrival. It was sunstroke, they said.
 
The long walk without water and food in the punishing heat had claimed its victim. “It is a very sad incident in our lives,” Naresh said.
Shocked by his death, Madakami’s friends asked the police for help to take his body home. They hired a vehicle and travelled to Pandripani village in Odisha.
Finally it was the youngster’s dead body that reached home.

"New York: With concerts on hold to halt coronavirus spread, the gaming world is increasingly catering to music lovers, with artists becoming animated performers in virtual realms to the trippy delight of millions.
The trend has gained momentum in recent weeks after the ultra-popular Fortnite morphed rapper Travis Scott into a massive psychedelic spaceman performing in a celestial dreamscape, as a record-setting 12.3 million concurrent players entered his 10-minute set inside the game.
 
According to the platform that’s spurred an international gaming craze since launching in 2017, over 27.7 million unique players participated in the Scott show across its premiere and four encore presentations.

"Mumbai: Big ticket releases such as Amitabh Bachchan’s Gulabo Sitabo may bypass theatres and premiere directly on digital platforms, being seen as a potential saviour for the film industry in a year marred by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty over when cinemas will open.
Faced with the question of going ‘direct to digital’ or waiting for theatres to open after the situation improves, many filmmakers and production houses are exploring the option of heading to streaming platforms, industry insiders said.
 
Shoojit Sircar’s Amitabh-Ayushman Khurrana starrer Gulabo Sitabo, Anu Menon’s eponymous biopic on math genius Shakuntala Devi, with Vidya Balan in the title role, as well as Chehre, another Amitabh film, are among the films likely to be released soon on a streaming platform.
“The deal of releasing ‘Gulabo Sitabo’, a quirky comedy set in Lucknow, and ‘Shakuntala Devi’ on Amazon Prime Video has been locked. The official announcement for both the films is most likely to be made this week,” a source close to the streamer told PTI.
 
Ronnie Lahiri, producer on “Gulabo Sitabo”, neither confirmed nor denied reports when PTI reached out to him but asked journalists to wait for an official statement.
An insider on the team of “Shakuntala Devi” also did not comment about the film’s digital release.
“Chehre” producer Anand Pandit said a digital release was under consideration.
“Given how the lockdown is panning out, a digital release for ‘Chehre’ is being mulled,” Pandit said, adding they would wait till the first week of June to take a final call.
 
The one official announcement was the release of Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s film “Ghoomketu”, which streamed on ZEE5 last week.
Most other plans are shrouded in secrecy with officials reluctant to come on record. But the list of 2020 films that will be released on streaming platforms is long, said insiders.
Top on the list is Laxmmi Bomb, featuring Akshay Kumar and backed by Fox Star Studios, which has reportedly been picked up by the recently launched service Disney+ Hotstar. However, Hotstar representatives maintained a “no comment” stance as did producer Tusshar Kapoor.
 
The movie, directed by Raghava Lawrence, was scheduled to be released on May 22 in theatres. That is unlikely to happen with no signs of cinema theatres opening even if the lockdown ends.
The other 2020 releases—Varun Dhawan-starrer Coolie No 1, Bachchan’s Jhund and Jahnvi Kapoor’s ‘Gunjan Saxena’—are also likely to head to different OTT platforms.
Kiara Advani-starrer Indoo Ki Jawani, co-produced by Nikkhil Advani and Bhushan Kumar, is also reportedly looking for a digital release.
However, Advani said the film is currently being edited “despite physical constraints” and the team is optimistic it will be ready “very soon”.
 
“We are exploring all possible avenues. Nothing stands confirmed or committed. As soon as we are clear about the way ahead, we will make a statement,” he said.
Bhushan’s T-Series’ has two other films, Ludo and Jhund.
While questions sent to Bhushan on the slate of his films were unanswered, a source from the production house confirmed that T-Series is planning to release its films digitally and talks are currently on.
There are also some producers who want to wait it out.
Producer Jackky Bhagnani, who was looking forward to the theatrical release of  Coolie No 1 on May 1, said he is not thinking about films right now.
 
“Let us overcome this crisis and we will announce in happier times,” Bhagnani said when asked about whether he was looking at releasing the film digitally.
Reliance Entertainment said it will wait to release two of this year’s most awaited films — Akshay starrer Sooryavanshi, and ‘83’, fronted by Ranveer Singh.
The team will wait for the lockdown to be lifted and release these movies in theatres.
“We will first complete the film then we will wait. If six or nine months down the line the situation becomes much worse we will take a call at that time. There is no hurry. Same is the case with Sooryavanshi and our other films,” Reliance Entertainment Group CEO Shibashish Sarkar told PTI last month.
 
Irrfan Khan’s last film Angrezi Medium headed to OTT platforms soon after its theatrical release as the lockdown led to cinema halls being closed.
“There is a lot of big money involved. Also, if you release on OTT you cannot release it in theatres. If you release a film in theatre it will come on satellite as well as digital later,” said trade analyst Taran Adarsh.
Last week, the Multiplex Association of India (MAI) appealed to studio partners, producers, artistes and content creators to support the cinema exhibition sector by holding their films and releasing them in theatres once they reopen.
 
The statement followed reports that several films were looking at a direct to digital release amid the lockdown.
The combination of “pent-up demand” and the promise of new movies would boost film business and contribute massively in reviving the industry, the association said.
“The collective, social experience of watching films on the big screen needs to be preserved and it can be done so only with the collective support of all stakeholders,” the statement from the body read.
“One can’t say the film will lose or gain from a digital release, because when you release a good film in theatres, the sky is the limit,” Adarsh added.

"Hyderabad: The relative of a person who died of Covid-19 on Sunday has refuted the Telangana government’s claim in its official daily Covid-19 media bulletin that there were no Covid-related deaths on Sunday. The death was not reported in the bulletin issued on Monday as well.
Aditya Belde, a resident of Ziaguda, said his 51-year-old paternal uncle died of the disease at Gandhi Hospital at around 10 am Sunday. “I want to know why his death has not been reported in the official bulletin which was released much later in the day. I think the officials had enough time to update the information,” he said.
 
Belde took to Twitter on Monday to report the death and sought an explanation from the government on the omission of his uncle’s demise from the health department’s report on the Covid-19 situation on Sunday.
Belde’s uncle had been suffering from a heart ailment for a few years. On Thursday, May 7, his health deteriorated, so the family took him to a private hospital. There, they were asked to get him tested for Covid-19 at a government hospital.
“My relatives took my uncle to Fever Hospital the same day. He was taken inside for just around 10 minutes, after which they said he didn’t have Covid-19 and could be taken home,” he said.
 
The patient’s health continued to deteriorate, and on Friday evening, the family took him to a corporate hospital in Begumpet, where he was treated previously. The doctors at this hospital informed the family that the patient needed to be on a ventilator and that he should be tested for Covid-19.
Accordingly a sample was collected and sent to Gandhi Hospital. “On Saturday night, the test results came back and we found he was Covid-19 positive,” said Belde.
Almost immediately, his uncle was processed for a transfer to Gandhi Hospital. Belde was told to accompany his uncle to do the formalities there. “We reached Gandhi Hospital at around 4:30 am and it took an hour before he was admitted. I wasn’t allowed to be near him but I could observe from a distance,” he said.
 
He returned home after a couple of hours. At around noon on Sunday, he got a call from a policeman who told him his uncle had passed away at 10 am on Sunday. By evening, the cremation had been arranged at a local crematorium, which no family member was able to attend.
Nine members of the deceased man’s family, including Belde, were transported to an isolation facility at the Government Ayurvedic Hospital at Erragadda as they lived together as a joint family.
Their swabs have since been taken for Covid-19 tests. Belde wonders why the government did not add his uncle’s death to the official bulletin. “It is very confusing. We need some clarity on this matter,” he said.
 
The family is also upset that their sick relative was made to run around various hospitals for three days before he was tested positive for Covid-19.
“At Coranti (Fever Hospital) they examined him for just 10 minutes and sent him home. They didn’t even collect his samples. Had he been tested earlier, he could have been saved,” Belde said.
At the corporate hospital the doctors told them about the test result only after they had made payment for the treatment there. “We paid Rs 1.70 lakh for my uncle’s treatment. Just 15 minutes later, we were told he was Covid-19 positive. We are extremely suspicious about this, to say the least,” he said.
 
Belde said that his uncle had no travel history. “Since the lockdown began in March, he left the house only a few times. He only went out to buy vegetables and groceries. He had no travel history,” he said.

"In the fight to halt the coronavirus, several countries have been touted as models to be emulated. Chiefly, South Korea is oft cited, justifiably so. However, no country has met with as much success in holding off and beating back the virus as Taiwan, whose geographical and cultural proximity, literally next door, to China makes the feat all the more remarkable. Contained in this narrative are valuable insights for other countries such as India that are still in the throes of this pandemic.
Situated a mere 130 km off the coast of mainland China, Taiwan has 850,000 to 1 million citizens who live or work in China. Although Beijing and Taipei are adversarial regimes, numerous daily flights link the island to multiple major cities in China. Given such proximity, Taiwan would likely be the most affected by any epidemic with origins in China. In fact, it was the hardest hit when SARS broke out in China in 2003. Taiwan then had the highest mortality rate in the world.
 
That did not happen this time.
Taiwan's Covid-19 numbers have been surprisingly low, for a country that has 2.7 million visitors from the mainland annually and almost 12,000 daily just before the Lunar New Year. As of May 12, Taiwan has 440 total coronavirus cases, of which 372 have already been cured. There have been only 7 deaths. With less than 100 active cases, Taiwan has halted the virus at its doorstep. It managed all this in spite of not being a member of the WHO and while organising a national election on January 11.
How was this possible?
 
Led by Experts
Remarkably, Taiwan’s strategy to combat the novel coronavirus nCoV19 was led by experts and scientists who responded with urgency to the initial outbreak in China. Taiwan’s vice-president, Chen Chien-jen is a Johns Hopkins University trained epidemiologist, public health expert and national hero for his role as health minister during the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Similarly, vice-premier Chen Chi-mai is a physician by training and former lecturer who collaborated with Minister for health and welfare Chen Shih-chung, a doctor and former director of Taipei Medical University. According to Channel News Asia (CNA), at 8 A.M on December 31, the latter was informed of at least seven atypical cases of pneumonia in Wuhan. Within an hour an inter-ministerial meeting was held to determine the measures to be taken to tackle the virus. 
 
This response was as agile as the response in Wuhan itself. Over the next few days, suspected-case reporting and hospital infection control measures were strengthened, a level-1 travel notice to Wuhan was announced, and by January 15 all hospitals and the public were notified about the emerging infectious disease. By January 20, Taiwan activated the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) to coordinate and lead the response to the virus. Daily briefings to the public conducted by health minister Chen Shih-chung, attended by nearly 100,000 people, were also important in keeping the public informed and aware. The health minister currently enjoys an approval rating of 91% in Taiwan and has become the country’s most popular politician, even more than President Tsai ing-wen.
 
Flight Screening and Border Controls
Allowing public health experts to direct the response to Covid-19 meant that Taiwan could make a crucial connection very very early: that air travel was the main pathway of virus transmission. So, Taipei acted quickly to restrict and monitor air travel.
On December 31, the very day China reported the outbreak to the WHO, Taiwan began sending healthcare officials into airplanes to check passengers arriving from Wuhan before they disembarked. Within a couple of days, these measures were expanded to include fever screening and full-scale medical examination of suspected cases. Within 10 days after the flareup of the mysterious new virus in Wuhan on January 21, Taiwan closed its borders to all Wuhan residents, and by 6 Feb extended the restrictions to all arrivals from China, six days before any other country did so. Taiwan also issued a ban on all port calls by international cruise ships on Feb 6, to prevent more cases like the Diamond Princess. To monitor all foreign arrivals into the country, passengers were required to sign and complete a health declaration form. As the virus began to spread outside China to places like Thailand and Singapore, travel advisories were issued to these places by February 11. By early March, all foreign arrivals without a residence permit were banned from entering the country.
 
By strange coincidence or premonition, nearly a fortnight before December 31,
on December 18, 2019, in fact, an awards ceremony was held in Taiwan for airlines with outstanding performance in disease surveillance and aviation safety. At the same event, Taiwan CDC, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced their joint collaboration in implementing the Program for Airlines on Disease Prevention, Preparedness and Response, and Emergency Management, the first of its kind in the world. 
 
Central Command Coordinated Measures
Activated on January 20, the Central Epidemic Command Centre proceeded to implement a total of 124 measures so far, including but not limited to border controls and fever screenings. One of the most significant of these was, contrary to WHO advice, a ban on the export of face masks and a decision to increase the production of protective equipment. The ban came into effect on Jan 24, one month before any other country adopted the same measure. According to the Vice-President, by the end of January, Taiwan stockpiled 44 million surgical masks, 1.95 million N-95 masks and 1,100 negative pressure isolation rooms. A national mask team was set up and 92 additional production lines were installed and the government requisitioned a total of 73 manufacturing companies. The policy increased the average daily production of masks from 1.9 million in January to 16 million masks daily in April. The CECC also instituted a rationing system for masks, according to which every citizen could buy 3 masks per week, then raised to 9 every fortnight, and finally an online ordering system was instituted.
 
Taiwan’s lightning-quick reaction has undoubtedly saved hundreds of lives and prevented thousands more from becoming infected. The island managed this without ever announcing a lockdown and significantly disrupting domestic economic and social life. Taiwan is also able to avoid, to a certain extent, the economic slump that follows a lockdown. Agencies like S&P and other economists have revised Taiwan’s GDP for 2020, but by a smaller margin than any other industrialised country. Schools, offices, restaurants and malls have remained open through the outbreak, limiting the disruption to the economy. Additionally, the island’s approach of involving the public in the fight against Covid-19 has the additional benefit of inculcating awareness in its public, making a transition to the new normal much smoother. With just 65 active cases left, Taiwan has turned its attention to other countries struggling to contain the virus, with the campaign TaiwanCanHelp, which donates masks and other resources.
 
Most of Taiwan’s measures to combat Covid-19 were announced in late January and early February, taking effect almost immediately. The credit for this accrues to experts and scientists holding political office, who lead the fight against Covid-19, calling the shots and responding to developments in China almost instantaneously. The promptness in enacting these measures has been shown by no other country. While some countries like India were busy hosting grand bilateral summits for foreign leaders and others like USA were turning the virus into a political weapon, Taiwan was preparing for the Covid-19 outbreak, which has held the country in good stead in the months following the initial stages of the outbreak.

"A recent post on M.S. Dhoni’s daughter Ziva’s account, which is managed by her parents, a video shows India’s most experienced Indian wicketkeeper and batsman enjoying quality father-daughter moments with Ziva.
In the video, the duo seem to be running a friendly race on their large, well-mowed and primly tended-to lawn at his Ranchi home.
 
And then began the relentless posts of the Captain Cool’s ‘latest looks’ of him with a full-grown salt-and-pepper beard, wearing a green T-shirt with the words “SPECIAL FORCES AIRBORNE” on it, standing
However, former Team Blues captain’s latest grey-bearded look seems to have disappointed many of his fans, sending Twitter into a frenzy. Some seem to have simply seen him as an unshaven, old man! “Aww... M. S Dhoni in Salt And Pepper Look... :-)) ?? (sic),” a CSK fan wrote.
In addition to comments highlighting disappointments were memes that showed “before and after” photos of Captain Cool.
 
One fan, for instance, posted two of Dhoni’s pictures. One was of his when he arrived in Chennai for the practice games of the now-called-off IPL matches sometime last month, seen clean-shaven with a close-crop crew-cut haircut. The second picture was a recent one of him in which he is seen.
One such meme had the caption, “Dhoni before lockdown vs after lockdown. March month he arrived Chennai with a fresh look & we would hve seen him in #Yellove now But corona had other idea & Ruined everything ????.”
Another CSK fan posted his recent pic and wrote against it, “How the men looks after carrying the entire burden and blame for past 10 years..!  This pic is very emotional msdians.. (sic).”
 
Another supposedly shaken fan wrote, “Dhoni looks so old.. (sic).”
Mother knows best
Even as people have been sharing sad emojis and wondering about their favourite cricketer’s cricketing plans (and there are indeed speculations about his retirement), his mother, Devaki, seems far from worried.
Speaking exclusively on the telephone from Ranchi, Devaki tells us, “Yes, I have seen his new look, but he’s not that old. No child is ever old for any mother.”
As for our apprehensions about his quitting the game, she adds, “I am not sure about his playing the TT-20 World Cup. He knows best when to take a call. Let the coronavirus outbreak get over first.”
 
Of course, there were compliments pouring in for the look too. “Vintage white beard look,” one fan wrote with the fire emoji next to it.

"Khammam: He waited 40 days as the lockdown kept getting extended, and when the special trains were announced it seemed like a ray of hope. But his village was nowhere near the train routes decided by the Centre. So 25-year-old Kasa Madakami and other migrant labourers began a 500-km walk from Hyderabad to Pandripani village in Malkangiri district in Odisha. After four days in the scorching heat, his journey ended abruptly in Bhadrachalam where he collapsed and died.
Madakami had been employed as a construction worker in Hyderabad. For him and his companions there was no hope left in the city after all the construction work had stopped. The only thing left to do was to go home to their families in their native villages, where everybody knew their names, where somebody cared for them.
 
It was just four days ago, after 40 days of being unemployed and stranded that they decided to start walking, with no hope of getting any government arranged means of transport. Left to their own means, they did not carry enough water and food with for the journey, Madakam Naresh, Madakami’s co-traveller, said.
Walking an average of 80 km a day, they had covered a distance of 320 km and reached Bhadrachalam in 40-degree Celsius heat on Tuesday.
All of a sudden, Madakami collapsed.
He was immediately taken to a hospital but doctors declared him dead on arrival. It was sunstroke, they said.
 
The long walk without water and food in the punishing heat had claimed its victim. “It is a very sad incident in our lives,” Naresh said.
Shocked by his death, Madakami’s friends asked the police for help to take his body home. They hired a vehicle and travelled to Pandripani village in Odisha.
Finally it was the youngster’s dead body that reached home.

"Mumbai: Big ticket releases such as Amitabh Bachchan’s Gulabo Sitabo may bypass theatres and premiere directly on digital platforms, being seen as a potential saviour for the film industry in a year marred by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty over when cinemas will open.
Faced with the question of going ‘direct to digital’ or waiting for theatres to open after the situation improves, many filmmakers and production houses are exploring the option of heading to streaming platforms, industry insiders said.
 
Shoojit Sircar’s Amitabh-Ayushman Khurrana starrer Gulabo Sitabo, Anu Menon’s eponymous biopic on math genius Shakuntala Devi, with Vidya Balan in the title role, as well as Chehre, another Amitabh film, are among the films likely to be released soon on a streaming platform.
“The deal of releasing ‘Gulabo Sitabo’, a quirky comedy set in Lucknow, and ‘Shakuntala Devi’ on Amazon Prime Video has been locked. The official announcement for both the films is most likely to be made this week,” a source close to the streamer told PTI.
 
Ronnie Lahiri, producer on “Gulabo Sitabo”, neither confirmed nor denied reports when PTI reached out to him but asked journalists to wait for an official statement.
An insider on the team of “Shakuntala Devi” also did not comment about the film’s digital release.
“Chehre” producer Anand Pandit said a digital release was under consideration.
“Given how the lockdown is panning out, a digital release for ‘Chehre’ is being mulled,” Pandit said, adding they would wait till the first week of June to take a final call.
 
The one official announcement was the release of Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s film “Ghoomketu”, which streamed on ZEE5 last week.
Most other plans are shrouded in secrecy with officials reluctant to come on record. But the list of 2020 films that will be released on streaming platforms is long, said insiders.
Top on the list is Laxmmi Bomb, featuring Akshay Kumar and backed by Fox Star Studios, which has reportedly been picked up by the recently launched service Disney+ Hotstar. However, Hotstar representatives maintained a “no comment” stance as did producer Tusshar Kapoor.
 
The movie, directed by Raghava Lawrence, was scheduled to be released on May 22 in theatres. That is unlikely to happen with no signs of cinema theatres opening even if the lockdown ends.
The other 2020 releases—Varun Dhawan-starrer Coolie No 1, Bachchan’s Jhund and Jahnvi Kapoor’s ‘Gunjan Saxena’—are also likely to head to different OTT platforms.
Kiara Advani-starrer Indoo Ki Jawani, co-produced by Nikkhil Advani and Bhushan Kumar, is also reportedly looking for a digital release.
However, Advani said the film is currently being edited “despite physical constraints” and the team is optimistic it will be ready “very soon”.
 
“We are exploring all possible avenues. Nothing stands confirmed or committed. As soon as we are clear about the way ahead, we will make a statement,” he said.
Bhushan’s T-Series’ has two other films, Ludo and Jhund.
While questions sent to Bhushan on the slate of his films were unanswered, a source from the production house confirmed that T-Series is planning to release its films digitally and talks are currently on.
There are also some producers who want to wait it out.
Producer Jackky Bhagnani, who was looking forward to the theatrical release of  Coolie No 1 on May 1, said he is not thinking about films right now.
 
“Let us overcome this crisis and we will announce in happier times,” Bhagnani said when asked about whether he was looking at releasing the film digitally.
Reliance Entertainment said it will wait to release two of this year’s most awaited films — Akshay starrer Sooryavanshi, and ‘83’, fronted by Ranveer Singh.
The team will wait for the lockdown to be lifted and release these movies in theatres.
“We will first complete the film then we will wait. If six or nine months down the line the situation becomes much worse we will take a call at that time. There is no hurry. Same is the case with Sooryavanshi and our other films,” Reliance Entertainment Group CEO Shibashish Sarkar told PTI last month.

"Washington: One week after Sally realised she was pregnant, her home state Texas temporarily banned abortions, deeming them unnecessary elective procedures that were suspended because of the coronavirus crisis.
So, the 34-year-old, whose name has been changed for this story to protect her privacy, took matters into her own hands—something she never would have considered in the past.
 
Having split with her boyfriend, she decided to buy pills on the internet, and perform her own abortion at home.
It’s illegal, and certainly stressful, but more and more women—faced with difficult decisions during a time of national crisis—are going that route.
“It came in a little Manila envelope. And it was just a five-pack of pills. No instructions—nothing,” Sally told AFP from her home in Dallas.
Getting the pills was not easy. The first two sites she consulted were out of stock. After sending $250 to a third site and enduring several long days of waiting, the envelope arrived.
 
By then, it had been 10 weeks since her last period—the absolute limit in the United States for a medical abortion.
“I was so terrified,” she said.
She googled online to figure out how to use the pills for what is called a “self-managed” abortion.
She took the first pill—mifepristone, commonly known in the US as RU-486, which is used to stop the development of the pregnancy.
The four other pills were misoprostol, which triggers the actual abortion. And then Sally took painkillers.
After a night of “really bad” cramps, and bleeding that “shocked” her, everything went as expected. Sally went back to work the following day, “relieved” that the pills worked properly.
 
“I would have rather had medical supervision, for sure,” she says without hesitation.
Beyond the legal ramifications, how does one find websites where the pills are sold? How do you make sure you get them quickly?
Dozens of women like Sally are exchanging advice, tips and notes about their experiences in the abortion forum on the popular social network Reddit.
Soaring sales
A woman’s right to have an abortion is protected by the landmark US Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade.
Even in normal times, that right has come under threat in some conservative-leaning US states. But several states sought to capitalize on the virus crisis to advance their campaigns.
 
There are also natural impediments to getting an abortion in a time of national crisis: the fear of getting infected at a clinic, the inability to leave home to get the procedure, or even financial distress due to sudden unemployment.
To help women buy their own pills online, the Plan C site lists eight online vendors, and ranks them in terms of price and speed of shipment.
The pills sold by those vendors have been tested and declared reliable in 2018.
One online retailer who asked not to be identified told AFP that sales in the US “increased by 150 percent in April compared to March.”
 
Visits to the Plan C website had doubled by late April as compared with a month before.
Plan C co-founder Elisa Wells said that while 900,000 abortions are performed each year in the United States, 40 percent of them medically, at least 10,000 are done “outside of the conventional medical establishment”—either via pills bought online or in Mexico.
What are the risks?
Abortions using mifepristone and misoprostol are safe, experts say. Complications that require medical intervention are rare.
“In the year 2020, in the United States, the real concerns about self-managed abortion aren’t physical but legal,” explains Jill Adams, the executive director of If/When/How, which puts women who want to abort on their own in touch with attorneys.
 
From mid-March through the end of that month, the association’s hotline received twice as many calls as usual.
Five US states—Arizona, Delaware, Idaho, Oklahoma and South Carolina—have laws that specifically ban self-managed abortion.
But women in other states are not really better protected: some local prosecutors use other laws to convict them, such as those forbidding the practice of medicine without a licence.
Some even charge women with child abuse, or drug-related offenses.
In late March, 21 states asked for the lifting of federal restrictions on sending mifepristone through the mail, saying it limits a woman’s use of telemedicine and forces women to “travel unnecessarily” despite stay-at-home orders.
 
To get around some of the US red tape, the websites offering abortion pills are operated from abroad.
Aid Access, which offers the least expensive abortion pills at $90 a dose, is the only one that has a medical supervisor, Dutch physician and activist Rebecca Gomperts.
For the past year, Gomperts has been locked in a battle with the US Food and Drug Administration, which demanded that she stop providing abortion services via telemedicine.
The pandemic has defeated her for the moment: she cannot get the pills she needs from India, which closed all of its airports.
 
Another online provider, which gets its supplies from Russia, told AFP that it expects to be out of stock for several weeks.
The only service that is authorized to send the pills—in 13 US states—is TelAbortion, which has been up and running since 2016, working with about 700 women.
In March and April, the number of women contacting TelAbortion doubled, as compared with the two previous months.

"New Delhi: Under lockdown and far apart, Sushen Dang and Keerti Narang went online to say their marriage vows—and pulled off a spectacular Indian wedding complete with thousands of guests and raucous Bollywood dancing.
In a country famous for lavish weddings that last for days, the young couple are among a growing number modifying their marriage ceremonies under a virus lockdown that has limited public gatherings.
 
Eager to go ahead with the arranged marriage on the auspicious date selected for them by a priest, the pair turned to the internet to tie the knot.
“We never imagined that even our online wedding would be so grand,” Dang, a 26-year-old data analyst who is based in Toronto, told AFP of the April 19 event.
“A hundred guests joined in our celebration on the app. We live-streamed the ceremony on Facebook which was watched by another 16,000 people.”
The nuptials spanned the country.
Dang, decked out in a turban and traditional sherwani kurta, logged on from Mumbai on the coast of the Arabian Sea, while Narang—in her red bridal finery—joined from Bareilly in northern Uttar Pradesh state that borders Nepal.
 
The priest overseeing proceedings chanted hymns as he sat before a ritual fire at his home in Raipur in the central state of Chhattisgarh, with guests logging in from Delhi, Gurgaon and the southern tech hub of Bangalore.
There were minor hiccups—some elderly family members were accidentally unmuted and pets photo-bombed screens.
But the energy levels remained high and the occasion was capped off with a fun Bollywood-style dance performance by their cousins.
The wedding video posted on Facebook has so far garnered nearly 260,000 views, making the newly-weds “feel like celebrities”.
 
Wedding blues 
The spread of the coronavirus and the nationwide lockdown took place as India’s wedding season was in full swing.
In western Rajasthan state alone some 23,000 weddings meant to coincide with the Hindu Akshaya Tritiya festival on April 26 were called off due to the pandemic.
More than 10 million weddings are held annually in the nation of 1.3 billion people, with the marriage industry estimated to be worth some $40-$50 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG.
The sector—like the rest of the economy—is reeling from the impact of the virus, with planners, caterers and decorators among those who have incurred huge losses.
 
“We thought, ‘Why don’t we be the flag-bearers and drive weddings online?’,” said Adhish Zaveri, marketing director at matrimonial website Shaadi.com which facilitated Dang and Narang’s wedding.
“A wedding is probably the most important day of somebody’s life ... and we thought we have to make it as special and close to a real wedding as possible,” he told AFP.
Online nuptials are among a string of weddings in India that have gone ahead amid the lockdown—with some unusual variations.
 
One couple in Uttar Pradesh said “I do” inside a police station after more conventional venues like banquet halls, hotels and temples were all ordered closed during the lockdown.
Home nuptials 
Zaveri said the significantly cheaper online ceremonies could become an option for couples amid the uncertainty about how long the pandemic is going to last.
Couples are charged less than 100,000 rupees ($1,300) for the virtual services, Zaveri said, adding 12 more such weddings were in the pipeline.
To give the online ceremonies a professional touch, make-up artists and sari-draping experts are hired to help the bride, while a folk singer is engaged to serenade the guests.
 
All participants are sent logins and passwords so that strangers can’t gatecrash the event.
Kirti Agrawal—who married her beau Avinash Singh Bagri on April 14 on the balcony of their relative’s flat as friends and family watched on a videoconferencing app—said the digital approach appealed to her.
“Their (groom’s) family had planned a guest list of 8,000 to 10,000,” Agrawal told AFP.
“It isn't that I am not a fan of big, fat weddings. But when I heard about the wedding-from-home idea, I was very happy.”

"Hyderabad: The relative of a person who died of Covid-19 on Sunday has refuted the Telangana government’s claim in its official daily Covid-19 media bulletin that there were no Covid-related deaths on Sunday. The death was not reported in the bulletin issued on Monday as well.
Aditya Belde, a resident of Ziaguda, said his 51-year-old paternal uncle died of the disease at Gandhi Hospital at around 10 am Sunday. “I want to know why his death has not been reported in the official bulletin which was released much later in the day. I think the officials had enough time to update the information,” he said.
 
Belde took to Twitter on Monday to report the death and sought an explanation from the government on the omission of his uncle’s demise from the health department’s report on the Covid-19 situation on Sunday.
Belde’s uncle had been suffering from a heart ailment for a few years. On Thursday, May 7, his health deteriorated, so the family took him to a private hospital. There, they were asked to get him tested for Covid-19 at a government hospital.
“My relatives took my uncle to Fever Hospital the same day. He was taken inside for just around 10 minutes, after which they said he didn’t have Covid-19 and could be taken home,” he said.
 
The patient’s health continued to deteriorate, and on Friday evening, the family took him to a corporate hospital in Begumpet, where he was treated previously. The doctors at this hospital informed the family that the patient needed to be on a ventilator and that he should be tested for Covid-19.
Accordingly a sample was collected and sent to Gandhi Hospital. “On Saturday night, the test results came back and we found he was Covid-19 positive,” said Belde.
Almost immediately, his uncle was processed for a transfer to Gandhi Hospital. Belde was told to accompany his uncle to do the formalities there. “We reached Gandhi Hospital at around 4:30 am and it took an hour before he was admitted. I wasn’t allowed to be near him but I could observe from a distance,” he said.
 
He returned home after a couple of hours. At around noon on Sunday, he got a call from a policeman who told him his uncle had passed away at 10 am on Sunday. By evening, the cremation had been arranged at a local crematorium, which no family member was able to attend.
Nine members of the deceased man’s family, including Belde, were transported to an isolation facility at the Government Ayurvedic Hospital at Erragadda as they lived together as a joint family.
Their swabs have since been taken for Covid-19 tests. Belde wonders why the government did not add his uncle’s death to the official bulletin. “It is very confusing. We need some clarity on this matter,” he said.
 
The family is also upset that their sick relative was made to run around various hospitals for three days before he was tested positive for Covid-19.
“At Coranti (Fever Hospital) they examined him for just 10 minutes and sent him home. They didn’t even collect his samples. Had he been tested earlier, he could have been saved,” Belde said.
At the corporate hospital the doctors told them about the test result only after they had made payment for the treatment there. “We paid Rs 1.70 lakh for my uncle’s treatment. Just 15 minutes later, we were told he was Covid-19 positive. We are extremely suspicious about this, to say the least,” he said.
 
Belde said that his uncle had no travel history. “Since the lockdown began in March, he left the house only a few times. He only went out to buy vegetables and groceries. He had no travel history,” he said.

"A recent post on M.S. Dhoni’s daughter Ziva’s account, which is managed by her parents, a video shows India’s most experienced Indian wicketkeeper and batsman enjoying quality father-daughter moments with Ziva.
In the video, the duo seem to be running a friendly race on their large, well-mowed and primly tended-to lawn at his Ranchi home.
 
And then began the relentless posts of the Captain Cool’s ‘latest looks’ of him with a full-grown salt-and-pepper beard, wearing a green T-shirt with the words “SPECIAL FORCES AIRBORNE” on it, standing
However, former Team Blues captain’s latest grey-bearded look seems to have disappointed many of his fans, sending Twitter into a frenzy. Some seem to have simply seen him as an unshaven, old man! “Aww... M. S Dhoni in Salt And Pepper Look... :-)) ?? (sic),” a CSK fan wrote.
In addition to comments highlighting disappointments were memes that showed “before and after” photos of Captain Cool.
 
One fan, for instance, posted two of Dhoni’s pictures. One was of his when he arrived in Chennai for the practice games of the now-called-off IPL matches sometime last month, seen clean-shaven with a close-crop crew-cut haircut. The second picture was a recent one of him in which he is seen.
One such meme had the caption, “Dhoni before lockdown vs after lockdown. March month he arrived Chennai with a fresh look & we would hve seen him in #Yellove now But corona had other idea & Ruined everything ????.”
Another CSK fan posted his recent pic and wrote against it, “How the men looks after carrying the entire burden and blame for past 10 years..!  This pic is very emotional msdians.. (sic).”
 
Another supposedly shaken fan wrote, “Dhoni looks so old.. (sic).”
Mother knows best
Even as people have been sharing sad emojis and wondering about their favourite cricketer’s cricketing plans (and there are indeed speculations about his retirement), his mother, Devaki, seems far from worried.
Speaking exclusively on the telephone from Ranchi, Devaki tells us, “Yes, I have seen his new look, but he’s not that old. No child is ever old for any mother.”
As for our apprehensions about his quitting the game, she adds, “I am not sure about his playing the TT-20 World Cup. He knows best when to take a call. Let the coronavirus outbreak get over first.”
 
Of course, there were compliments pouring in for the look too. “Vintage white beard look,” one fan wrote with the fire emoji next to it.

"London: Bitcoin miners, whose computer processors enable the running of the world’s most popular virtual currency, will soon face an event that takes place every four years and alters the profitability of the hi-tech industry.
So-called halving is when cryptocurrency-mining companies and individuals find out the reduced payment that they will receive in return for their contribution to the system’s smooth operation.
 
Bitcoin was created in 2008 by a person or group writing under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto as a peer-to-peer decentralised electronic cash system.
The virtual unit was once the preserve of internet geeks and hobbyists but it has since exploded in popularity, with mining performed by huge banks of computers.
How does mining work
Bitcoins are traded via a decentralised registry system known as a blockchain.
The system requires massive computer processing power in order to manage and implement transactions.
That power is provided by miners, who do so in the hope they will receive new bitcoins for validating transaction data.
 
The system poses a complex computer puzzle to decide which miner wins the privilege to validate the block and thus receive the reward.
“To understand halving, it is important to remember the role of miners, who are basically responsible for the bitcoin network security,” ThinkMarkets analyst Fawad Razaqzada told AFP.
“Each time a block of bitcoin transaction takes place, they need to be verified by miners. The miner that verifies each block gets a reward for its work with more, newly created, bitcoins.”
What is halving?
 
This occurs every four years and basically involves the halving of the reward from bitcoin mining.
The cryptocurrency’s first “halving” occurred in November 2012, and the second in July 2016. The third is widely expected to take place around next Tuesday.
“Halving will impact profitability of mining bitcoin because work and resources will need to double in order to achieve the same reward as before,” added Razaqzada.
“However, if the value of bitcoin appreciates significantly then this will offset some of the costs.”
 
Commercial mining operations often occupy huge hangers or warehouses, and consume large amounts of electricity to power and cool the computers, which is a considerable cost in addition to equipment.
Why reduce the reward?
The reward was originally set at 50 bitcoins but it was subsequently reduced to 12.5 and will likely reach just 6.25 next week.
The amount has been trimmed over time in order to implement an overall global limit of 21 million bitcoins.
“With the supply of bitcoins mandated to eventually reach the limit of 21 million, the creator(s) of the digital currency had decided that these rewards must decay exponentially, otherwise supply will not be controlled,” added Razaqzada.
 
“So, the network is programmed to cut the reward every 210,000 blocks, or about every four years,” he said, noting that the halving date depended on mining activity.
What is bitcoin worth?
Bitcoin stood late Tuesday at $9,200 (Rs 7,00,000 approx) after a choppy few months linked to coronavirus markets turmoil.
That compares with $7,100 (Rs 5,40,000 approx) at the start of the year, according to Bloomberg data, but it remains far from the record high $19,511 (Rs 14,80,000) hit in December 2017.
“February and March were rough months for bitcoin like other risk assets, but the digital currency has staged the most impressive recovery,” said Razaqzada.
 
“This is partly due to the fact some investors consider bitcoin to be a safe-haven asset, while some have undoubtedly bought speculatively ahead of the so-called ‘halving’ event in anticipation (that) we may see the value of the cryptocurrency appreciate.”

"Washington: One week after Sally realised she was pregnant, her home state Texas temporarily banned abortions, deeming them unnecessary elective procedures that were suspended because of the coronavirus crisis.
So, the 34-year-old, whose name has been changed for this story to protect her privacy, took matters into her own hands—something she never would have considered in the past.
 
Having split with her boyfriend, she decided to buy pills on the internet, and perform her own abortion at home.
It’s illegal, and certainly stressful, but more and more women—faced with difficult decisions during a time of national crisis—are going that route.
“It came in a little Manila envelope. And it was just a five-pack of pills. No instructions—nothing,” Sally told AFP from her home in Dallas.
Getting the pills was not easy. The first two sites she consulted were out of stock. After sending $250 to a third site and enduring several long days of waiting, the envelope arrived.
 
By then, it had been 10 weeks since her last period—the absolute limit in the United States for a medical abortion.
“I was so terrified,” she said.
She googled online to figure out how to use the pills for what is called a “self-managed” abortion.
She took the first pill—mifepristone, commonly known in the US as RU-486, which is used to stop the development of the pregnancy.
The four other pills were misoprostol, which triggers the actual abortion. And then Sally took painkillers.
After a night of “really bad” cramps, and bleeding that “shocked” her, everything went as expected. Sally went back to work the following day, “relieved” that the pills worked properly.
 
“I would have rather had medical supervision, for sure,” she says without hesitation.
Beyond the legal ramifications, how does one find websites where the pills are sold? How do you make sure you get them quickly?
Dozens of women like Sally are exchanging advice, tips and notes about their experiences in the abortion forum on the popular social network Reddit.
Soaring sales
A woman’s right to have an abortion is protected by the landmark US Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade.
Even in normal times, that right has come under threat in some conservative-leaning US states. But several states sought to capitalize on the virus crisis to advance their campaigns.
 
There are also natural impediments to getting an abortion in a time of national crisis: the fear of getting infected at a clinic, the inability to leave home to get the procedure, or even financial distress due to sudden unemployment.
To help women buy their own pills online, the Plan C site lists eight online vendors, and ranks them in terms of price and speed of shipment.
The pills sold by those vendors have been tested and declared reliable in 2018.
One online retailer who asked not to be identified told AFP that sales in the US “increased by 150 percent in April compared to March.”
 
Visits to the Plan C website had doubled by late April as compared with a month before.
Plan C co-founder Elisa Wells said that while 900,000 abortions are performed each year in the United States, 40 percent of them medically, at least 10,000 are done “outside of the conventional medical establishment”—either via pills bought online or in Mexico.
What are the risks?
Abortions using mifepristone and misoprostol are safe, experts say. Complications that require medical intervention are rare.
“In the year 2020, in the United States, the real concerns about self-managed abortion aren’t physical but legal,” explains Jill Adams, the executive director of If/When/How, which puts women who want to abort on their own in touch with attorneys.
 
From mid-March through the end of that month, the association’s hotline received twice as many calls as usual.
Five US states—Arizona, Delaware, Idaho, Oklahoma and South Carolina—have laws that specifically ban self-managed abortion.
But women in other states are not really better protected: some local prosecutors use other laws to convict them, such as those forbidding the practice of medicine without a licence.
Some even charge women with child abuse, or drug-related offenses.
In late March, 21 states asked for the lifting of federal restrictions on sending mifepristone through the mail, saying it limits a woman’s use of telemedicine and forces women to “travel unnecessarily” despite stay-at-home orders.
 
To get around some of the US red tape, the websites offering abortion pills are operated from abroad.
Aid Access, which offers the least expensive abortion pills at $90 a dose, is the only one that has a medical supervisor, Dutch physician and activist Rebecca Gomperts.
For the past year, Gomperts has been locked in a battle with the US Food and Drug Administration, which demanded that she stop providing abortion services via telemedicine.
The pandemic has defeated her for the moment: she cannot get the pills she needs from India, which closed all of its airports.
 
Another online provider, which gets its supplies from Russia, told AFP that it expects to be out of stock for several weeks.
The only service that is authorized to send the pills—in 13 US states—is TelAbortion, which has been up and running since 2016, working with about 700 women.
In March and April, the number of women contacting TelAbortion doubled, as compared with the two previous months.

"New Delhi: Under lockdown and far apart, Sushen Dang and Keerti Narang went online to say their marriage vows—and pulled off a spectacular Indian wedding complete with thousands of guests and raucous Bollywood dancing.
In a country famous for lavish weddings that last for days, the young couple are among a growing number modifying their marriage ceremonies under a virus lockdown that has limited public gatherings.
 
Eager to go ahead with the arranged marriage on the auspicious date selected for them by a priest, the pair turned to the internet to tie the knot.
“We never imagined that even our online wedding would be so grand,” Dang, a 26-year-old data analyst who is based in Toronto, told AFP of the April 19 event.
“A hundred guests joined in our celebration on the app. We live-streamed the ceremony on Facebook which was watched by another 16,000 people.”
The nuptials spanned the country.
Dang, decked out in a turban and traditional sherwani kurta, logged on from Mumbai on the coast of the Arabian Sea, while Narang—in her red bridal finery—joined from Bareilly in northern Uttar Pradesh state that borders Nepal.
 
The priest overseeing proceedings chanted hymns as he sat before a ritual fire at his home in Raipur in the central state of Chhattisgarh, with guests logging in from Delhi, Gurgaon and the southern tech hub of Bangalore.
There were minor hiccups—some elderly family members were accidentally unmuted and pets photo-bombed screens.
But the energy levels remained high and the occasion was capped off with a fun Bollywood-style dance performance by their cousins.
The wedding video posted on Facebook has so far garnered nearly 260,000 views, making the newly-weds “feel like celebrities”.
 
Wedding blues 
The spread of the coronavirus and the nationwide lockdown took place as India’s wedding season was in full swing.
In western Rajasthan state alone some 23,000 weddings meant to coincide with the Hindu Akshaya Tritiya festival on April 26 were called off due to the pandemic.
More than 10 million weddings are held annually in the nation of 1.3 billion people, with the marriage industry estimated to be worth some $40-$50 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG.
The sector—like the rest of the economy—is reeling from the impact of the virus, with planners, caterers and decorators among those who have incurred huge losses.
 
“We thought, ‘Why don’t we be the flag-bearers and drive weddings online?’,” said Adhish Zaveri, marketing director at matrimonial website Shaadi.com which facilitated Dang and Narang’s wedding.
“A wedding is probably the most important day of somebody’s life ... and we thought we have to make it as special and close to a real wedding as possible,” he told AFP.
Online nuptials are among a string of weddings in India that have gone ahead amid the lockdown—with some unusual variations.
 
One couple in Uttar Pradesh said “I do” inside a police station after more conventional venues like banquet halls, hotels and temples were all ordered closed during the lockdown.
Home nuptials 
Zaveri said the significantly cheaper online ceremonies could become an option for couples amid the uncertainty about how long the pandemic is going to last.
Couples are charged less than 100,000 rupees ($1,300) for the virtual services, Zaveri said, adding 12 more such weddings were in the pipeline.
To give the online ceremonies a professional touch, make-up artists and sari-draping experts are hired to help the bride, while a folk singer is engaged to serenade the guests.
 
All participants are sent logins and passwords so that strangers can’t gatecrash the event.
Kirti Agrawal—who married her beau Avinash Singh Bagri on April 14 on the balcony of their relative’s flat as friends and family watched on a videoconferencing app—said the digital approach appealed to her.
“Their (groom’s) family had planned a guest list of 8,000 to 10,000,” Agrawal told AFP.
“It isn't that I am not a fan of big, fat weddings. But when I heard about the wedding-from-home idea, I was very happy.”

"Washington: A majority of the US H-1B employers, including tech giants like Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft, use the temporary work visa programme to pay the migrant workers well below market wages, a new report has claimed.
The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers from countries like India and China in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.
 
Nearly 500,000 migrant workers are employed in the US in the H-1B status.
""Among the top 30 H-1B employers are major US firms including Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, Google, Apple and Facebook. All of them take advantage of program rules in order to legally pay many of their H-1B workers below the local median wage for the jobs they fill,"" said the report released by the Economic Policy Institute.
Authored by Daniel Costa and Ron Hira, the report titled ""H-1B visas and prevailing wage levels"" says 60 per cent of H-1B positions certified by the US Department of Labor (DOL) are assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation.
 
While the H-1B programme rules allow this, the DOL has the authority to change it, but has not, it said.
While over 53,000 employers used the H-1B programme in 2019, the top 30 H-1B employers accounted for more than one in four of all 389,000 H-1B petitions approved by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2019, it said.
Half of the top 30 H-1B employers use an outsourcing business model to provide staff for third-party clients, rather than employing H-1B workers directly to fill a special need at the company that applies for the visa, the report said.
 
The report alleged that major US-based technology firms that hire H-1B workers directly, rather than contract them out to third-party employers, had significant shares of their certified H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2, the two lowest wage levels in fiscal 2019, both of which are below the local median wage.
""Until now, much of the public discourse and proposals for reforming H-1B have focused on rules that would constrain the practices of these outsourcing companies,"" the report said.
But researches reveal that many firms that employ H-1B workers directly, including some of the biggest names in the technology industry such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Qualcomm, Salesforce and Uber, pay a large share of their H-1B workers at one of the two lowest wage levels, Level 1 or Level 2.
 
In addition, these direct-hire firms also hire many H-1B workers on a contract basis through outsourcing firms, it added.
Microsoft, the seventh-largest H-1B employer in 2019, assigned one-third (35 per cent) of its positions on Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) as Level 1 and two-fifths (42 per cent) as Level 2. In total, Microsoft assigned more than three-quarters (77 per cent) of its H-1B positions as Level 1 or Level 2, a wage level below the local median wage.
Microsoft assigned only 18 per cent of its positions as Level 3 (the median) wage, and a mere three per cent as Level 4, the only above-median wage level.
 
Amazon, which appears twice in the H-1B top 30, as ""Amazon.com Services"" (no. 4 among the biggest H-1B employers) and ""Amazon Web Services"" (no. 27), also assigned the vast majority of its H-1B positions at one of the two lowest wage levels.
According to the report, Amazon.com Services assigned 34 per cent of its H-1B positions as Level 1 and 51 per cent as Level 2, for a total of 86 per cent of all positions certified.
Amazon Web Services assigned 47 per cent of its H-1B workers as Level 1 and 36 per cent as Level 2. Combined, Amazon.com Services and Amazon Web Services had 12,428 positions certified at Level 1 or 2, for a total of 85 per cent certified at a wage level below the median. Only one in eight (1,684) were certified at or above the 50th percentile (Level 3 or Level 4), it said.
 
Apple, eleventh on the list, assigned 558 of its H-1B positions (two per cent) as Level 1 and one-third (32 per cent) as Level 2, for a combined total of 34 per cent at Levels 1 and 2. Apple assigned 32 per cent as Level 3 and 34 per cent as Level 4.
Google, ranked the fifth-largest H-1B employer, had 9,085 H-1B positions certified by the DOL in fiscal 2019. It assigned less than half of one per cent of its certified H-1B jobs as Level 1 and 54 per cent as Level 2. Only 37 per cent of Google's jobs were certified at or above the median wage, the report said.
 
Facebook assigned only one position as Level 1 and 10 per cent of its 6,118 total H-1B positions as Level 2. Twenty-five per cent were certified at Level 3 and 16 per cent at Level 4. Nearly half (49 per cent) of Facebook's H-1B positions were certified at a wage established by an alternative wage survey, making it difficult to assess its H-1B wage distribution, it said.
Uber, the 29th-ranked H-1B employer in 2019, had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by the DOL. Less than one per cent was assigned as Level 1 and just over half (53 per cent) as Level 2. Just over one-third were assigned as Level 3 and 13 per cent as Level 4.
 
While Uber had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by DOL and hired 1,160 H-1B workers in 2019, in the same year, it made headlines by laying off 400 employees.
The report claims that the top 30 H-1B employers are in fact hiring H-1B workers to fill a very large number of routine (Levels 1 and 2) positions that require relatively little experience and ordinary skills.

"Raipur: The Chhattisgarh government has launched a web portal for home delivery of liquor in green zones of the state to avoid crowding at wine shops during the coronavirus-enforced lockdown, an official said on Tuesday. 
The portal has been named after the state-run CSMCL (Chhattisgarh State Marketing Corporation Limited), which controls the sale of liquor in the state, a public relations department official here said.
 
The liquor shops, which were closed since March 23, opened from Monday across the state, except in the COVID-19 containment zones and shopping malls, following the Centres decision to ease some curbs during the lockdown.  But, a large number of people queued up outside liquor outlets in the state capital Raipur and other districts, defying the physical distancing norms.
“The state government has given permission for online sale of liquor so that crowding at wine shops can be discouraged,” the official said.
People can book orders directly through the CSMCL website or its mobile app available on Play Store.  However, the home delivery facility will not be available in Raipur and Korba districts which are not classified as green zones, the official said.
 
The Centre has classified districts as red, orange and green zones based on the COVID-19 risk profiling.
People will have to register their mobile number, Aadhaar number and address to place an order online, which will be confirmed through an OTP (one time password).  A customer can order up to 5,000 ml of liquor at a time for home delivery, the official said, adding that the delivery charge is Rs 120.

"Higher education in the US is expensive and has led to crippling financial debt for a lot of youngsters—so much so that one of the main campaign promises of the erstwhile presidential election candidate Bernie Sanders was to waive student loans. So, when students who've paid a bomb for the famed campus experience at premier universities were sent home to learn online during the coronavirus pandemic, they didn't feel they got their money's worth.
Now, students at more than 25 US universities are filing lawsuits against their schools demanding partial refunds on tuition and campus fees, saying they’re not getting the calibre of education they were promised.
 
The suits say students should pay lower rates for the portion of the term that was offered online, arguing that the quality of instruction is far below the classroom experience.
Colleges, though, reject the idea that refunds are in order. Students are learning from the same professors who teach on campus, officials have said, and they’re still earning credits toward their degrees. 
Grainger Rickenbaker, 21, who filed a class-action lawsuit against Drexel University in Philadelphia, said there's little interaction with students or professors and some classes are being taught almost entirely through recorded videos, with no live lecture or discussion.
 
Other students report similar experiences elsewhere. A complaint against the University of California, Berkeley, says some professors are simply uploading assignments, with no video instruction at all. A case against Vanderbilt University says class discussion has been stymied and the “quality and academic rigor of courses has significantly decreased.”
In a case against Purdue University, a senior engineering student said the closure has prevented him from finishing his senior project, building an airplane. “No online course can simulate the applicable, real-world experience” he hoped to gain from the project, the complaint says.
 
Class-action lawsuits demanding tuition refunds have been filed against at least 26 colleges, targeting prestigious private universities, including Brown, Columbia and Cornell, along with big public schools, including Michigan State, Purdue and the University of Colorado, Boulder.
Some of the suits draw attention to schools’ large financial reserves, saying colleges are unfairly withholding refunds even while they rest on endowments that often surpass USD 1 billion.
Several colleges declined to comment on the lawsuits, but some said students have continued to get what they paid for.
 
Ken McConnellogue, a spokesman for the University of Colorado, said it’s disappointing that people have been so quick to file lawsuits only weeks into the pandemic. He said the suits appear to be driven by a small number of “opportunistic” law firms.
Lawyers representing students, however, say the refunds are a matter of fairness.
“You cannot keep money for services and access if you aren’t actually providing it,” said Roy Willey, a lawyer for the Anastopoulo Law Firm in South Carolina, which is representing students in more than a dozen cases. “If we’re truly going to be all in this together, the universities have to tighten their belts and refund the money back to students and families who really need it.”
 
Willey said his office has received hundreds of inquiries from students looking to file suits, and his firm is looking into dozens of possible cases. Other firms taking on similar cases say they’re also seeing a wave of demand from students and parents who say they deserve refunds.
Along with tuition, the cases also seek refunds for fees that students paid to access gyms, libraries, labs and other buildings that are now closed. All told, the complaints seek refunds that could add up to several thousand dollars per student at some schools.
 
Scores of schools have returned portions of housing and dining fees, but few if any have agreed to return any share of tuition.
At the University of Chicago, hundreds of students signed a letter saying they will refuse to pay this term’s tuition, which was due April 29, unless the school reduces tuition by 50% and keeps it at that level during the crisis.
The lawsuits ask courts to answer a thorny question that has come to the fore as universities shift classes online: whether there’s a difference in value between online instruction and the traditional classroom.
 
Willey adds that colleges themselves often charge lower rates for online classes, which he says is a reflection of their value.

"Washington: A majority of the US H-1B employers, including tech giants like Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft, use the temporary work visa programme to pay the migrant workers well below market wages, a new report has claimed.
The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers from countries like India and China in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.
 
Nearly 500,000 migrant workers are employed in the US in the H-1B status.
""Among the top 30 H-1B employers are major US firms including Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, Google, Apple and Facebook. All of them take advantage of program rules in order to legally pay many of their H-1B workers below the local median wage for the jobs they fill,"" said the report released by the Economic Policy Institute.
Authored by Daniel Costa and Ron Hira, the report titled ""H-1B visas and prevailing wage levels"" says 60 per cent of H-1B positions certified by the US Department of Labor (DOL) are assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation.
 
While the H-1B programme rules allow this, the DOL has the authority to change it, but has not, it said.
While over 53,000 employers used the H-1B programme in 2019, the top 30 H-1B employers accounted for more than one in four of all 389,000 H-1B petitions approved by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2019, it said.
Half of the top 30 H-1B employers use an outsourcing business model to provide staff for third-party clients, rather than employing H-1B workers directly to fill a special need at the company that applies for the visa, the report said.
 
The report alleged that major US-based technology firms that hire H-1B workers directly, rather than contract them out to third-party employers, had significant shares of their certified H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2, the two lowest wage levels in fiscal 2019, both of which are below the local median wage.
""Until now, much of the public discourse and proposals for reforming H-1B have focused on rules that would constrain the practices of these outsourcing companies,"" the report said.
But researches reveal that many firms that employ H-1B workers directly, including some of the biggest names in the technology industry such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Qualcomm, Salesforce and Uber, pay a large share of their H-1B workers at one of the two lowest wage levels, Level 1 or Level 2.
 
In addition, these direct-hire firms also hire many H-1B workers on a contract basis through outsourcing firms, it added.
Microsoft, the seventh-largest H-1B employer in 2019, assigned one-third (35 per cent) of its positions on Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) as Level 1 and two-fifths (42 per cent) as Level 2. In total, Microsoft assigned more than three-quarters (77 per cent) of its H-1B positions as Level 1 or Level 2, a wage level below the local median wage.
Microsoft assigned only 18 per cent of its positions as Level 3 (the median) wage, and a mere three per cent as Level 4, the only above-median wage level.
 
Amazon, which appears twice in the H-1B top 30, as ""Amazon.com Services"" (no. 4 among the biggest H-1B employers) and ""Amazon Web Services"" (no. 27), also assigned the vast majority of its H-1B positions at one of the two lowest wage levels.
According to the report, Amazon.com Services assigned 34 per cent of its H-1B positions as Level 1 and 51 per cent as Level 2, for a total of 86 per cent of all positions certified.
Amazon Web Services assigned 47 per cent of its H-1B workers as Level 1 and 36 per cent as Level 2. Combined, Amazon.com Services and Amazon Web Services had 12,428 positions certified at Level 1 or 2, for a total of 85 per cent certified at a wage level below the median. Only one in eight (1,684) were certified at or above the 50th percentile (Level 3 or Level 4), it said.
 
Apple, eleventh on the list, assigned 558 of its H-1B positions (two per cent) as Level 1 and one-third (32 per cent) as Level 2, for a combined total of 34 per cent at Levels 1 and 2. Apple assigned 32 per cent as Level 3 and 34 per cent as Level 4.
Google, ranked the fifth-largest H-1B employer, had 9,085 H-1B positions certified by the DOL in fiscal 2019. It assigned less than half of one per cent of its certified H-1B jobs as Level 1 and 54 per cent as Level 2. Only 37 per cent of Google's jobs were certified at or above the median wage, the report said.
 
Facebook assigned only one position as Level 1 and 10 per cent of its 6,118 total H-1B positions as Level 2. Twenty-five per cent were certified at Level 3 and 16 per cent at Level 4. Nearly half (49 per cent) of Facebook's H-1B positions were certified at a wage established by an alternative wage survey, making it difficult to assess its H-1B wage distribution, it said.
Uber, the 29th-ranked H-1B employer in 2019, had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by the DOL. Less than one per cent was assigned as Level 1 and just over half (53 per cent) as Level 2. Just over one-third were assigned as Level 3 and 13 per cent as Level 4.
 
While Uber had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by DOL and hired 1,160 H-1B workers in 2019, in the same year, it made headlines by laying off 400 employees.
The report claims that the top 30 H-1B employers are in fact hiring H-1B workers to fill a very large number of routine (Levels 1 and 2) positions that require relatively little experience and ordinary skills.

"Rio De Janeiro: Rarely have two words ignited such a firestorm of controversy.
""So what?"" said Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday when a journalist asked him about the fact that more than 5,000 Brazilians had died of the coronavirus.
 
The far-right leader's off-the-cuff comment has been sparking anger ever since, with governors, politicians, healthcare professionals and media figures all weighing in to express their outrage at his lack of empathy.
Bolsonaro is no stranger to controversy. But his latest remark sparked such a fury because Brazil is facing a seemingly uncontrollable outbreak of the disease and is still several weeks away from the peak of the pandemic, with a death toll that threatens to surpass even the most dire predictions.
There have been more than 91,000 officially confirmed cases so far but scientists warn the real figure could be 15 to 20 times higher.
 
With a death toll that has already topped 6,300, the giant South American country is facing as grim a scenario as Italy or the United States.
""So what? I'm sorry. What do you want me to do?"" Bolsonaro said Tuesday when questioned about his country passing the 5,000-death mark, more than China. He joked that even though his middle name is Messias, or Messiah, ""I don't do miracles.""
Wilson Witzel, the governor of Rio de Janeiro state, called the president's remarks ""absolutely unacceptable.""
With his own state on the verge of a public health meltdown, Witzel slammed the president for ""being ironic about the deaths"" rather than ""being a leader at such a moment.""
 
""Do your job,"" he said on Twitter Wednesday, the day when the pro-gun president was training at a target range, far from the woes of Brazil's 210 million citizens.
'Brasilia bubble'
Joao Doria, governor of Sao Paulo state which is also on the frontlines of the battle against the coronavirus with more than 2,500 deaths already, replied furiously to Bolsonaro in the capital Brasilia.
""Get out of your Brasilia bubble,"" he retorted, urging Bolsonaro to visit hospitals ""in this country which is crying for its dead and infected.""
 
Unlike many other heads of state, the Brazilian leader has not been seen in any hospitals nor has he expressed much solidarity with victims of the disease, bereaved families or healthcare staff who have condemned the lack of ventilators or beds.
The head of the doctors' union in Sao Paulo, Eder Gatti, called on television for ""a more serious attitude from the president of the republic.""
Bolsonaro ""shows very little sensitivity to the tragedies that the families of those directly affected by the pandemic are going through,"" said Lucio Renno, director of the Institute of Political Science at Brasilia University.
 
""His style is the iron fist, to be hard rather than to show solidarity or empathy,"" he told AFP.
It is a style that inevitably draws comparison with Bolsonaro's own role model, US President Donald Trump.
That type of reaction is ""shocking for a large part of the population"" and ""reinforces the idea for a good part of the elites and for the Brazilian people that he is not fit to govern,"" Renno said.
Miriam Leitao, an op-ed writer at the daily O Globo, wrote on Thursday that with his ""So what?"" Bolsonaro had ""renounced the presidency.""
 
""Anyone who shows such contempt for his own people can no longer be president,"" she wrote.
'Judged by history'
In a tactic he has honed since becoming president, Bolsonaro quickly went on the offensive in the face of criticism from the governors and mayors, whom the Supreme Court has granted the power to call the shots in the fight against the pandemic.
""Ask Joao Doria or (Bruno) Covas [the mayor of Sao Paulo] why people continue to die even when they have taken such restrictive measures,"" said the president.
 
""They are the ones who should have the answers, you can't pin that on me.""
Nevertheless the press on Friday blamed the spike in infections and death on Bolsonaro, who has encouraged people to go out to work to prevent an economic crash and whose most fervent supporters have taken to the streets to protest against lockdown orders.
Bolsonaro's ""So what?"" has ""underscored how little importance he has attached to the situation,"" said political analyst Andre Pereira Cesar.
""If the president does not assume a wartime leadership stance against the virus he will be judged harshly -- by history and by voters,"" he warned.

"Raipur: The Chhattisgarh government has launched a web portal for home delivery of liquor in green zones of the state to avoid crowding at wine shops during the coronavirus-enforced lockdown, an official said on Tuesday. 
The portal has been named after the state-run CSMCL (Chhattisgarh State Marketing Corporation Limited), which controls the sale of liquor in the state, a public relations department official here said.
 
The liquor shops, which were closed since March 23, opened from Monday across the state, except in the COVID-19 containment zones and shopping malls, following the Centres decision to ease some curbs during the lockdown.  But, a large number of people queued up outside liquor outlets in the state capital Raipur and other districts, defying the physical distancing norms.
“The state government has given permission for online sale of liquor so that crowding at wine shops can be discouraged,” the official said.
People can book orders directly through the CSMCL website or its mobile app available on Play Store.  However, the home delivery facility will not be available in Raipur and Korba districts which are not classified as green zones, the official said.
 
The Centre has classified districts as red, orange and green zones based on the COVID-19 risk profiling.
People will have to register their mobile number, Aadhaar number and address to place an order online, which will be confirmed through an OTP (one time password).  A customer can order up to 5,000 ml of liquor at a time for home delivery, the official said, adding that the delivery charge is Rs 120.

"Friends and foes
BJP leader Subramanian Swamy and TV news anchor Arnab Goswami have little in common but they have had a blow-cold-blow-hot relationship with Sonia Gandhi. In 1998-99, when Sonia formally entered politics and Goswami was a beat reporter with a prominent TV news channel, he was often spotted at 24, Akbar Road, or outside 10, Janpath. On one occasion, Sonia stopped abruptly to give Goswami a soundbite, a first for any news channel. For months Goswami gushed and seldom missed an opportunity to say “hi” to madam. In 2014, he managed a long interview with Rahul Gandhi, which subsequently damaged Rahul’s reputation as a serious politician. Congress sources insist the interview materialised, courtesy Priyanka Gandhi who offered Goswami “chai-pakoda” during the rainy season at her New Delhi residence. Goswami’s recent diatribe against Sonia, therefore, surprised and shocked 10, Janpath.
 
Subramnian Swamy has been both friend and foe to both Sonia and Goswami. Swamy teamed up with Sonia and Jayalalithaa to bring down the Atal Behari Vajpayee regime and caused irreparable damage to his rapport with both ladies. Incidentally, along with Raj Thackeray, Swamy holds the distinction of taming Goswami on air. When Republic TV was launched, Swamy wrote to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting taking exception to the usage 'Republic' for a commercial venture by Arnab. Swamy said that under the Emblems and Names Act, 1950, certain names and emblems such as 'Republic' are prohibited from use for professional and commercial purposes.
 
Manmohan dazed?
Sonia Gandhi has set up a consultative panel to respond to Narendra Modi government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. However, Dr Manmohan Singh, who confers with Rahul Gandhi, P. Chidambaram, Jairam Ramesh and other members of the panel, is finding the video-conference meetings problematic. Often, he misses out on what others are saying. Panel members say the former prime minister looks dazed. But wife Gursharan Kaur insists Manmohan looks forward to the meeting every day.
Shivraj’s dubious choices
The recent Cabinet expansion conducted by Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan disappointed many. About a dozen BJP hopefuls had reportedly parked themselves in Bhopal even though the state capital was a coronavirus hotspot. There were reports that the state garage requisitioned 12 cars but the move was shelved and only five ministers made it. Three former state health ministers, Narottam Mishra, Tulsi Silawat and Kamal Patel (he was minister in charge of medical education), made it without anyone asking why the MP health infrastructure was so weak. The three BJP ministers are not considered personally loyal to Chouhan while the two Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalists are non-MLAs. Given the uncertainly over the coronavirus, many wonder how Chouhan would ensure Assembly by-polls within six months. MP does not have a second house or legislative council.
 
Mishra has in the past been accused of “paid news” during the 2008 Assembly polls. The Election Commission unanimously asked for Mishra’s disqualification but the Delhi high Court set aside the disqualification.
Varun’s dream
For the discerning viewer, Varun Gandhi’s Twitter timeline showering fulsome praise on prime minister Narendra Modi’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is not without significance. Varun tries to draw Modi’s attention at a time when the buzz is that Jyotiraditya Scindia is set to join the Union cabinet. A Gandhi surname and a series of uninterrupted electoral successes have not bolstered Varun’s chances in the Modi government even though his mother is no longer a minister. Is the PM paying attention to Varun’s subtext? Doesn't appear so.
 
Caste in stone
A religious figure is supposed to renounce worldly considerations like caste, sub-caste, etc. But supporters of a CM of a northern state are reportedly working on a strategy to regroup former bureaucrats, academicians, intellectuals, media and others on a caste-based platform. The idea is not new: Chandrashekhar, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, Digvijaya Singh and Rajnath Singh's camp followers tried a similar tactic without success.
Trouble for Shashi Tharoor
MP Shashi Tharoor found himself in a bit of a spot after he announced with fanfare an online meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on information technology. Apparently, Tharoor, a former Union minister of state and a UN official, hurriedly made the announcement after a cursory conversation with Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla. The Lok Sabha secretariat communicated to the speaker that rules to switch over to online meetings have not been approved. The speaker’s office then informed Tharoor that having a meeting of parliamentary panels via video-conferencing will violate the confidentiality clause. A volte-face followed.

"Higher education in the US is expensive and has led to crippling financial debt for a lot of youngsters—so much so that one of the main campaign promises of the erstwhile presidential election candidate Bernie Sanders was to waive student loans. So, when students who've paid a bomb for the famed campus experience at premier universities were sent home to learn online during the coronavirus pandemic, they didn't feel they got their money's worth.
Now, students at more than 25 US universities are filing lawsuits against their schools demanding partial refunds on tuition and campus fees, saying they’re not getting the calibre of education they were promised.
 
The suits say students should pay lower rates for the portion of the term that was offered online, arguing that the quality of instruction is far below the classroom experience.
Colleges, though, reject the idea that refunds are in order. Students are learning from the same professors who teach on campus, officials have said, and they’re still earning credits toward their degrees. 
Grainger Rickenbaker, 21, who filed a class-action lawsuit against Drexel University in Philadelphia, said there's little interaction with students or professors and some classes are being taught almost entirely through recorded videos, with no live lecture or discussion.
 
Other students report similar experiences elsewhere. A complaint against the University of California, Berkeley, says some professors are simply uploading assignments, with no video instruction at all. A case against Vanderbilt University says class discussion has been stymied and the “quality and academic rigor of courses has significantly decreased.”
In a case against Purdue University, a senior engineering student said the closure has prevented him from finishing his senior project, building an airplane. “No online course can simulate the applicable, real-world experience” he hoped to gain from the project, the complaint says.
 
Class-action lawsuits demanding tuition refunds have been filed against at least 26 colleges, targeting prestigious private universities, including Brown, Columbia and Cornell, along with big public schools, including Michigan State, Purdue and the University of Colorado, Boulder.
Some of the suits draw attention to schools’ large financial reserves, saying colleges are unfairly withholding refunds even while they rest on endowments that often surpass USD 1 billion.
Several colleges declined to comment on the lawsuits, but some said students have continued to get what they paid for.
 
Ken McConnellogue, a spokesman for the University of Colorado, said it’s disappointing that people have been so quick to file lawsuits only weeks into the pandemic. He said the suits appear to be driven by a small number of “opportunistic” law firms.
Lawyers representing students, however, say the refunds are a matter of fairness.
“You cannot keep money for services and access if you aren’t actually providing it,” said Roy Willey, a lawyer for the Anastopoulo Law Firm in South Carolina, which is representing students in more than a dozen cases. “If we’re truly going to be all in this together, the universities have to tighten their belts and refund the money back to students and families who really need it.”
 
Willey said his office has received hundreds of inquiries from students looking to file suits, and his firm is looking into dozens of possible cases. Other firms taking on similar cases say they’re also seeing a wave of demand from students and parents who say they deserve refunds.
Along with tuition, the cases also seek refunds for fees that students paid to access gyms, libraries, labs and other buildings that are now closed. All told, the complaints seek refunds that could add up to several thousand dollars per student at some schools.
 
Scores of schools have returned portions of housing and dining fees, but few if any have agreed to return any share of tuition.
At the University of Chicago, hundreds of students signed a letter saying they will refuse to pay this term’s tuition, which was due April 29, unless the school reduces tuition by 50% and keeps it at that level during the crisis.
The lawsuits ask courts to answer a thorny question that has come to the fore as universities shift classes online: whether there’s a difference in value between online instruction and the traditional classroom.
 
Willey adds that colleges themselves often charge lower rates for online classes, which he says is a reflection of their value.

"Chennai: “I have had no income since the lockdown began and I have no money left. I have absolutely no idea as to how I will survive this,” said Neelavathi.
As coronavirus victim tales go, this narrative is not entirely a unique one. Neelavathi’s trade, like most other trades, has been dealt a mortal blow, rendering her penniless.
 
But unlike other daily wage earners, who have social support systems, Neelavathi has no one to tell her story to. She’s a commercial sex worker (CSW). Though the problems she mentions are similar to anybody else’s -- no transport, long queues at shops and police chasing her away in the street -- her lack of work is unique. Not only can she not work from home, there’s no place where her clients can reach her.
On a normal day, Neelavathi steps out for work around 10 am and is back home by around 5 pm. She is one of the CSWs engaged to a ‘house’ in Moolakadi, where she is paid Rs 300 for every client she services. At times she may go out with a client to a lodge or a guest house and make Rs 1000 or more. But that happens rarely.
 
Whatever it is, on an average she used to make Rs 500 per day, which was just enough to feed her two children and her. Since she commutes by bus and autorickshaw, the lockdown has left her immobile, confined to her house.
Besides, she has another worry: She has run out of condoms. As a member of the Red Hills Thai Vizhuthugal Nala Sangam, a community-based organisation (CBO) of CSWs, she’s acutely aware of the need for condoms and regularly visits Red Hills to collect her quota of prophylactics.
The president of Red Hills Thai, Poongodi, said the lockdown came out of the blue. After the coronavirus scare began, at an annual meeting of the collective recently, they had discussed the precautions to be taken against the virus. But the lockdown caught them unawares.
 
The CBO has about 1300 members, all of them CSWs. Many of the women often turn to Poongodi for help but this time the CBO is not equipped to give them any.
The president of the Namakkal District Thai Vizhuthugal Women’s Trust, Geetanjali, put out a message on her Facebook page on April 4 seeking help for the members of her trust, many of whom were going without food.
She said among her members were women who lived below the poverty line and those afflicted by HIV.
She told Deccan Chronicle that many of her members were having just a single meal a day and had no money for other basic needs. Some of the women were living alone with no family support and their plight was the worst, she said.
 
The Nammakkal-based CBO has about 1,500 members, living in villages around the town. Geethanjali fears that the coronavirus crisis might lead to a spread of HIV.
How so? She explained that CSWs pushed to the brink are at risk of giving in to sexual demands in lieu of minor financial or material favours in this time of distress and may thus indulge in risky behaviour due to the lackc of a prophylactic.
Agreeing with her, A J Hariharan of the Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO) said CSWs were primarily responsible for containing the spread of HIV in the country in the past. Hariharan, who has been into AIDS/HIV prevention work since the early 1990s, said it was due to the insistence of these women on use of condoms that stopped the HIV infection.
 
Hariharan said there are 6,300 CSWs in Chennai alone and about 90,000 in the whole of Tamil Nadu. All of them have been hit by the lockdown. Even before the coronavirus, many of them lived in abject poverty. Now the loss of livelihood has affected them so badly they cry on the phone while asking for help.
“We have a stomach to feed,” says Latha, who has never faced a situation like this in her six-year career as a CSW.  She has two children to take care of. Normally she would earn about Rs 1000 a day, serving an average of three clients. She used to work from 11 am to 5.30 pm at a ‘house’ near Moolakadi.
 
Latha has not stepped out of street in Vyasarapadi since the lockdown began. But she has found an alternative career to make money from her house. She has started making tea and selling it on the street. She makes about Rs 100 a day. “Something is better than nothing,” she says.

"Ever since Doordarshan announced the re-telecast of some of their iconic TV shows, the actors and producers of the said shows have been at loggerheads.
The decision to air 11 popular shows from the 80s and 90s was taken amidst the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 .
 
The national broadcaster has recorded an all-time high audience as the channel ever since has registered a 650 per cent growth in its viewership.
According to BARC India, the first four shows of Ramanand Sagar’s 'Ramayana' garnered 170 million impressions and DD National became the most-watched channel across the country.
This was followed by the re-runs of classics such as 'Byomkesh Bakshi', 'Shaktimaan', 'Buniyaad', 'Circus', 'Dekh Bhai Dekh', 'Alif Laila', 'Chanakya', 'Upanishad Ganga' and 'The Jungle Book', which became equally popular in the first week and even attracted several sponsors.
 
Due for their diligence
This rekindled popularity has once again drawn the attention to many seasoned yet forgotten actors who had become household names when their shows aired for the first time.
So it’s hardly surprising that some of them are now demanding a royalty from the profits of this re-telecast. 'Byomkesh Bakshi' actor 'Sunil Sinha', in a Facebook post, wrote that the channel and producer should give royalty money to the actors.
“When the government has decided to re-telecast the show, the channel and producer will make money. So when the producer is getting extra money, why not the actors and technicians who have worked hard on the show?” the actor asks.
 
Similarly, Dipika Chikhlia, who played Sita in the epic 'Ramayana' opposite Arun Govil’s Ram, feels that the cast of the show should be respected for their contributions.
“Money doesn’t harm anybody and I would have liked to see the profits shared with the actors as well,” says the actress. She also adds that the actors of the iconic mythological show weren’t duly paid well even when the show was shot.
“Everyone knows when the Ramayana was made, we were paid peanuts. It would have been really nice if we were shown some kind of appreciation with the makers sharing the profits with us,” she says.
 
Trickle down theory
Veteran actress Pallavi Joshi, who played an integral part in the popular 80s show 'Buniyaad', says that India should have adapted the concept of extending royalty to actors, a practice common in the US.
“Actors are actually forced to do a lot of work that they don’t wish to because of not having royalties in place, so it should have been introduced long back,” says the actress.
Mita Vashisht, who shared the screen with Shah Rukh Khan and Ashutosh Gowarikar in the iconic show 'Circus', adds that the industry is not mature enough to acknowledge the efforts of all involved.
 
“It is the actors who have made these shows popular. In a healthy industry, some percentage of royalty should be given to everyone. But our industry is not thoughtful in terms of royalties,” says the 'Dil Se' actress, who feels that everyone needs to respect the actors and technicians’ contributions.
Producers differ
But the producers of these iconic shows, have a parallel view on the matter. For instance, 'Shaktimaan' actor Mukesh Khanna, who is also the producer of the show, clarifies that actors sign a contract agreeing that they will not claim any money or royalty upon the re-telecast of the show, which means that they have no legal claim.
 
“It is not done. Certain things are contractual and actors have to abide by it. The producer can recover the money by all means. As an actor, I would say it sounds good. But as a producer, I will be making money from everywhere,” says the actor who is also a part of the on-going epic show 'Mahabharata' on DD.
“Besides, most of them are seasoned actors and they are doing pretty well in the industry, so why to give them royalty?” he says, refuting the claims made by actors seeking a share of the pie.
Joshi however disagrees with Khanna and feels the claims made by the actors are valid. “The channel hasn’t produced any show, and the effort made by the producer during a re-run is zero. So when the producer is getting the extra money then he should distribute a percentage of it to the actors and technicians who are at home in these difficult times and struggling to put food on the table for their children,” she says.

"Friends and foes
BJP leader Subramanian Swamy and TV news anchor Arnab Goswami have little in common but they have had a blow-cold-blow-hot relationship with Sonia Gandhi. In 1998-99, when Sonia formally entered politics and Goswami was a beat reporter with a prominent TV news channel, he was often spotted at 24, Akbar Road, or outside 10, Janpath. On one occasion, Sonia stopped abruptly to give Goswami a soundbite, a first for any news channel. For months Goswami gushed and seldom missed an opportunity to say “hi” to madam. In 2014, he managed a long interview with Rahul Gandhi, which subsequently damaged Rahul’s reputation as a serious politician. Congress sources insist the interview materialised, courtesy Priyanka Gandhi who offered Goswami “chai-pakoda” during the rainy season at her New Delhi residence. Goswami’s recent diatribe against Sonia, therefore, surprised and shocked 10, Janpath.
 
Subramnian Swamy has been both friend and foe to both Sonia and Goswami. Swamy teamed up with Sonia and Jayalalithaa to bring down the Atal Behari Vajpayee regime and caused irreparable damage to his rapport with both ladies. Incidentally, along with Raj Thackeray, Swamy holds the distinction of taming Goswami on air. When Republic TV was launched, Swamy wrote to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting taking exception to the usage 'Republic' for a commercial venture by Arnab. Swamy said that under the Emblems and Names Act, 1950, certain names and emblems such as 'Republic' are prohibited from use for professional and commercial purposes.
 
Manmohan dazed?
Sonia Gandhi has set up a consultative panel to respond to Narendra Modi government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. However, Dr Manmohan Singh, who confers with Rahul Gandhi, P. Chidambaram, Jairam Ramesh and other members of the panel, is finding the video-conference meetings problematic. Often, he misses out on what others are saying. Panel members say the former prime minister looks dazed. But wife Gursharan Kaur insists Manmohan looks forward to the meeting every day.
Shivraj’s dubious choices
The recent Cabinet expansion conducted by Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan disappointed many. About a dozen BJP hopefuls had reportedly parked themselves in Bhopal even though the state capital was a coronavirus hotspot. There were reports that the state garage requisitioned 12 cars but the move was shelved and only five ministers made it. Three former state health ministers, Narottam Mishra, Tulsi Silawat and Kamal Patel (he was minister in charge of medical education), made it without anyone asking why the MP health infrastructure was so weak. The three BJP ministers are not considered personally loyal to Chouhan while the two Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalists are non-MLAs. Given the uncertainly over the coronavirus, many wonder how Chouhan would ensure Assembly by-polls within six months. MP does not have a second house or legislative council.
 
Mishra has in the past been accused of “paid news” during the 2008 Assembly polls. The Election Commission unanimously asked for Mishra’s disqualification but the Delhi high Court set aside the disqualification.
Varun’s dream
For the discerning viewer, Varun Gandhi’s Twitter timeline showering fulsome praise on prime minister Narendra Modi’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is not without significance. Varun tries to draw Modi’s attention at a time when the buzz is that Jyotiraditya Scindia is set to join the Union cabinet. A Gandhi surname and a series of uninterrupted electoral successes have not bolstered Varun’s chances in the Modi government even though his mother is no longer a minister. Is the PM paying attention to Varun’s subtext? Doesn't appear so.
 
Caste in stone
A religious figure is supposed to renounce worldly considerations like caste, sub-caste, etc. But supporters of a CM of a northern state are reportedly working on a strategy to regroup former bureaucrats, academicians, intellectuals, media and others on a caste-based platform. The idea is not new: Chandrashekhar, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, Digvijaya Singh and Rajnath Singh's camp followers tried a similar tactic without success.
Trouble for Shashi Tharoor
MP Shashi Tharoor found himself in a bit of a spot after he announced with fanfare an online meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on information technology. Apparently, Tharoor, a former Union minister of state and a UN official, hurriedly made the announcement after a cursory conversation with Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla. The Lok Sabha secretariat communicated to the speaker that rules to switch over to online meetings have not been approved. The speaker’s office then informed Tharoor that having a meeting of parliamentary panels via video-conferencing will violate the confidentiality clause. A volte-face followed.

"Hyderabad: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has notified the state government to extend the lockdown in the state capital till the end of May.
Covid-19 cases have been increasing at alarming pace in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits. Another 30 cases were reported on Friday. Mayor Bonthu Rammohan puts the blame on the people and said if they do not cooperate with the government and observe the lockdown strictly, it would be extended until the coronavirus cases reach zero.
 
Rammohan said chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao has taken a very serious view of people violating the lockdown protocol and may come up with stringent rules after the Cabinet meeting scheduled on April 19. He noted that though about 45,000 vehicles have been seized for violating lockdown rules, people were still moving about on the roads using fake passes.
""We have been keeping strict vigil only in the containment zones by trusting the others. The government is clueless about the number of coronavirus positive cases in the remaining areas. If the public movement is not curtailed and if they do not cooperate with the government, they are risking their lives and those of others,” he said.
 
He cited other cases, one of an onion seller in Rajendernagar who came in contact with a Nizamuddin Markaz returnee and interacted with 45 others and later tested positive and that of a migrant who travelled in a train with Markaz returnees and was asymptomatic but one of his contacts, his landlady, died.
“We are not sure whether a 14-day quarantine is enough to contain Covid-19. I advise people to quarantine for 28 days even though they have tested negative,"" Rammohan said.
He said May would be favourable to contain Covid-19 and the arrival of the monsoon in June could complicate the situation as other contagious diseases spread with the rains.
 
""It is not easy to manage a city with a huge population. The public should abide by the law to contain the deadly virus,"" he said.
He urged residents to click pictures of those who violate social distancing norms at supermarkets, meat shops and other markets and post them on social media platforms. The corporation would seal all the shops for the lockdown period, he said.

"Chennai: “I have had no income since the lockdown began and I have no money left. I have absolutely no idea as to how I will survive this,” said Neelavathi.
As coronavirus victim tales go, this narrative is not entirely a unique one. Neelavathi’s trade, like most other trades, has been dealt a mortal blow, rendering her penniless.
 
But unlike other daily wage earners, who have social support systems, Neelavathi has no one to tell her story to. She’s a commercial sex worker (CSW). Though the problems she mentions are similar to anybody else’s -- no transport, long queues at shops and police chasing her away in the street -- her lack of work is unique. Not only can she not work from home, there’s no place where her clients can reach her.
On a normal day, Neelavathi steps out for work around 10 am and is back home by around 5 pm. She is one of the CSWs engaged to a ‘house’ in Moolakadi, where she is paid Rs 300 for every client she services. At times she may go out with a client to a lodge or a guest house and make Rs 1000 or more. But that happens rarely.
 
Whatever it is, on an average she used to make Rs 500 per day, which was just enough to feed her two children and her. Since she commutes by bus and autorickshaw, the lockdown has left her immobile, confined to her house.
Besides, she has another worry: She has run out of condoms. As a member of the Red Hills Thai Vizhuthugal Nala Sangam, a community-based organisation (CBO) of CSWs, she’s acutely aware of the need for condoms and regularly visits Red Hills to collect her quota of prophylactics.
The president of Red Hills Thai, Poongodi, said the lockdown came out of the blue. After the coronavirus scare began, at an annual meeting of the collective recently, they had discussed the precautions to be taken against the virus. But the lockdown caught them unawares.
 
The CBO has about 1300 members, all of them CSWs. Many of the women often turn to Poongodi for help but this time the CBO is not equipped to give them any.
The president of the Namakkal District Thai Vizhuthugal Women’s Trust, Geetanjali, put out a message on her Facebook page on April 4 seeking help for the members of her trust, many of whom were going without food.
She said among her members were women who lived below the poverty line and those afflicted by HIV.
She told Deccan Chronicle that many of her members were having just a single meal a day and had no money for other basic needs. Some of the women were living alone with no family support and their plight was the worst, she said.
 
The Nammakkal-based CBO has about 1,500 members, living in villages around the town. Geethanjali fears that the coronavirus crisis might lead to a spread of HIV.
How so? She explained that CSWs pushed to the brink are at risk of giving in to sexual demands in lieu of minor financial or material favours in this time of distress and may thus indulge in risky behaviour due to the lackc of a prophylactic.
Agreeing with her, A J Hariharan of the Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO) said CSWs were primarily responsible for containing the spread of HIV in the country in the past. Hariharan, who has been into AIDS/HIV prevention work since the early 1990s, said it was due to the insistence of these women on use of condoms that stopped the HIV infection.
 
Hariharan said there are 6,300 CSWs in Chennai alone and about 90,000 in the whole of Tamil Nadu. All of them have been hit by the lockdown. Even before the coronavirus, many of them lived in abject poverty. Now the loss of livelihood has affected them so badly they cry on the phone while asking for help.
“We have a stomach to feed,” says Latha, who has never faced a situation like this in her six-year career as a CSW.  She has two children to take care of. Normally she would earn about Rs 1000 a day, serving an average of three clients. She used to work from 11 am to 5.30 pm at a ‘house’ near Moolakadi.
 
Latha has not stepped out of street in Vyasarapadi since the lockdown began. But she has found an alternative career to make money from her house. She has started making tea and selling it on the street. She makes about Rs 100 a day. “Something is better than nothing,” she says.

"Bengaluru: In this summer of the coronavirus, who doesn’t have a tale of woe? For farmers it’s all-too familiar a situation: just when the crop is coming to hand, a natural disaster strikes and they are unable to reach the market in time and the produce rots in the field.
For horticulturists, this has been such a time: there’s a severe shortage of summer fruits and vegetables in the cities, but they are unable to market their produce.
 
Amidst this gloom, grape farmers in and around Bengaluru have got together to pull off a miracle. Unobtrusively and unknown to many, hundreds of grape growers have coalesced into a direct marketing movement in and around the city.
By skirting market structures and lockdown barriers, they are reaching resident welfare associations direct and selling their produce straight to the consumer.
This movement was initiated by the University of Agriculture Sciences (UAS) Alumni Association to help grape farmers find a market in this corona-hit summer.
 
Look at the difference this is making: while the government-run procurement agency HOPCOMS picks up an average of 2-3 tons of grapes per day from farmers, the direct marketing initiative is moving 250-300 tons a day.
UAS Alumni Association president Dr K Narayangowda says he never dreamed of such a huge response from the people. 
How it began
Around the time when the coronavirus lockdown was declared, vineyards around Bengaluru were approaching harvest. The country was already in the grip of the coronavirus, and a total shutdown of markets spelt disaster for grape growers.
 
Bengaluru’s vines are not linked to the food processing industry; they sell most of their produce to the consumer. If they are shut out now, the crop would have to be destroyed.
Export to other states was out of the question, not with the transport system down and a lockdown everywhere else too. “We had to find a market right here,” said Narayanagowda.
So 12 days ago, the UAS Alumni Association knit up the farmers into a patchwork collective linked with WhatsApp, and made pitches to a few residents’ association.
 
“To understand the market, we went to the HOPCOMS main centre near Lalbagh. We found HOPCOMS procuring grapes for Rs 45 per kg from the farmer and selling it through its outlet just adjacent to the procurement centre for Rs 115 per kg. We were shocked by the margin it was making,'' Narayanagowda said.
Then they visited farmers in the Kolar and Chikkaballapur region and started working out the cost. Farmers were educated on how to pack them and what time they had to harvest once the order was confirmed and delivery schedules.
 
 “We realised that Rs 55 per kg was an ideal price for farmers and we started reaching out to residents' associations by publicising our WhatsApp number. We landed a first order for 1.5 tons,” says Narayanagowda.
It was a good deal for the consumers: where they had to go to the market and buy grapes at Rs 120 per kg, they were getting the same stuff at their doorstep for no more than Rs 55-60 per kg.
In the next three days, the number of orders just baffled them. “We have a lot of residents' association working with farmers. At Rajarajeshwari Nagar, the Rotary Club president has taken the lead and four sets of farmers are supplying them grapes. At the end of the week, we ended up selling over 250-300 tons per day in Bengaluru alone. Besides learning about the market, many farmers are also directly exploring some of the markets,'' he said.
 
“We learnt a lot of things about grape marketing. In the first place, Bengaluru people were never exposed to quality grapes by traders. Very few had access to quality grapes. Some had given up eating grapes. Now, everyday new grape fans are being added to the list. We are making a database and we’ll launch online marketing by next year,'' says Narayanagowda.
What about mango?
The cooperative is planning to try the grape tactics with mango, which is just beginning to come into the market. The mango market is in a similar situation as grape: it cannot be shipped out of the state.
 
However, the grape tactics did not work with other fruits and vegetables. Tomato is harvested at the same time as grapes but its market is different. Over 80 per cent of tomato grown around Bengaluru goes to the Kissan factory for making sauce. But the since the factory is closed, there was no way farmers could find an alternative market. Traders refused to pick up the excess tomato because prices would crash. So farmers had no choice but to let the produdce rot on the farm.
Though vegetable demand and supply remains the same, the situation is exploited by traders. Citing social distance, they have created distance between product and consumer, driving the prices up. But farmers get no dividend from this.

"Ever since Doordarshan announced the re-telecast of some of their iconic TV shows, the actors and producers of the said shows have been at loggerheads.
The decision to air 11 popular shows from the 80s and 90s was taken amidst the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 .
 
The national broadcaster has recorded an all-time high audience as the channel ever since has registered a 650 per cent growth in its viewership.
According to BARC India, the first four shows of Ramanand Sagar’s 'Ramayana' garnered 170 million impressions and DD National became the most-watched channel across the country.
This was followed by the re-runs of classics such as 'Byomkesh Bakshi', 'Shaktimaan', 'Buniyaad', 'Circus', 'Dekh Bhai Dekh', 'Alif Laila', 'Chanakya', 'Upanishad Ganga' and 'The Jungle Book', which became equally popular in the first week and even attracted several sponsors.
 
Due for their diligence
This rekindled popularity has once again drawn the attention to many seasoned yet forgotten actors who had become household names when their shows aired for the first time.
So it’s hardly surprising that some of them are now demanding a royalty from the profits of this re-telecast. 'Byomkesh Bakshi' actor 'Sunil Sinha', in a Facebook post, wrote that the channel and producer should give royalty money to the actors.
“When the government has decided to re-telecast the show, the channel and producer will make money. So when the producer is getting extra money, why not the actors and technicians who have worked hard on the show?” the actor asks.
 
Similarly, Dipika Chikhlia, who played Sita in the epic 'Ramayana' opposite Arun Govil’s Ram, feels that the cast of the show should be respected for their contributions.
“Money doesn’t harm anybody and I would have liked to see the profits shared with the actors as well,” says the actress. She also adds that the actors of the iconic mythological show weren’t duly paid well even when the show was shot.
“Everyone knows when the Ramayana was made, we were paid peanuts. It would have been really nice if we were shown some kind of appreciation with the makers sharing the profits with us,” she says.
 
Trickle down theory
Veteran actress Pallavi Joshi, who played an integral part in the popular 80s show 'Buniyaad', says that India should have adapted the concept of extending royalty to actors, a practice common in the US.
“Actors are actually forced to do a lot of work that they don’t wish to because of not having royalties in place, so it should have been introduced long back,” says the actress.
Mita Vashisht, who shared the screen with Shah Rukh Khan and Ashutosh Gowarikar in the iconic show 'Circus', adds that the industry is not mature enough to acknowledge the efforts of all involved.
 
“It is the actors who have made these shows popular. In a healthy industry, some percentage of royalty should be given to everyone. But our industry is not thoughtful in terms of royalties,” says the 'Dil Se' actress, who feels that everyone needs to respect the actors and technicians’ contributions.
Producers differ
But the producers of these iconic shows, have a parallel view on the matter. For instance, 'Shaktimaan' actor Mukesh Khanna, who is also the producer of the show, clarifies that actors sign a contract agreeing that they will not claim any money or royalty upon the re-telecast of the show, which means that they have no legal claim.
 
“It is not done. Certain things are contractual and actors have to abide by it. The producer can recover the money by all means. As an actor, I would say it sounds good. But as a producer, I will be making money from everywhere,” says the actor who is also a part of the on-going epic show 'Mahabharata' on DD.
“Besides, most of them are seasoned actors and they are doing pretty well in the industry, so why to give them royalty?” he says, refuting the claims made by actors seeking a share of the pie.
Joshi however disagrees with Khanna and feels the claims made by the actors are valid. “The channel hasn’t produced any show, and the effort made by the producer during a re-run is zero. So when the producer is getting the extra money then he should distribute a percentage of it to the actors and technicians who are at home in these difficult times and struggling to put food on the table for their children,” she says.

"New Delhi: The Indian Army has asked its personnel to use the Covid-19 contact-tracing app Aarogya Setu with caution while following all cyber security precautions.
While urging download of the Aarogya Setu app, it advised personnel to avoid it in office premises, operational areas and sensitive locations. Personnel, veterans and families have been asked to cyber security precautions.
 
Aarogya Setu is a mobile app developed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to help citizens identify their risk of contracting Covid-19.
“Existing cyber security policies on usage of mobile phones must be adhered to by army personnel while using the Aarogya Setu app,” the soldiers were informed, said sources.
The Indian Army has asked its personnel to only switch on the location services and bluetooth features of the Aarogya Setu app while visiting public places, or when they are engaged in managing isolation centres, while on call for COVID-19 related assistance to civil authorities and while out of cantonments or military stations for essential administrative duties.
 
They have been told not to disclose their service identity including rank and appointment. The contact list of the user should not contain any reference to rank appointment or service. Army personnel have been advised to keep their mobile operating systems updated and to install antivirus protection on their cell phones.
The Aarogya Setu app has crossed the 5 crore downloads in just the 13 days since it was launched.
The app uses bluetooth, GPS, algorithms and artificial intelligence to notify users of their risk of catching the COVID-19 infection, by tracing the same data from other users of the app. 
 
The app detects other devices with Aarogya Setu installed that come in the proximity of that phone. GPS tracks the location of the user in real time and bluetooth tracks if and when the user comes in close proximity with someone infected by COVID-19. 
If a user comes into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, they will be notified about it in a few days. The app has access to the Government of India’s database of known cases.

"Chennai: WhatsApp on Tuesday put spokes in the ever-turning wheel of misinformation by restricting forwards to just one chat at a time. The update has come to India first, in an indication of how widely the platform is being used to spread unverified information in the country. It will soon be rolled out globally.
Similarly in August 2018, WhatsApp limited forwarding to five chats after the platform found it was being used extensively in India to spread misinformation, fake news and propaganda.
 
The app, which has 2 billion users worldwide introduced the curbs globally around January 2019. NDTV reported that WhatsApp claimed the restrictions led to a 25 per cent decrease in forwards globally.
The report also cited consulting firm Kantar as having found a 40 per cent increase in WhatsApp usage as COVID-19 began spreading globally. The messaging app owned by Facebook was reported to have made the “greatest gains” in usage among social media apps.
Now, with fake news threatening to derail efforts to combat the deadly coronavirus pandemic, WhatsApp, which has 400 million users in India, has introduced the stricter curbs in the country.
 
However, one can still use the forward option several times to send a message to multiple users or copy a message and paste it to various chats.
To ensure that users got only authoritative information on COVID-19, WhatsApp had recently collaborated with the Government of India to create a chat bot to answer queries.
Earlier, in August, WhatsApp added a ‘Forwarded’ label to messages that were not composed by a close contact of the user.
Last month, the app also took measures to mark certain forward messages as requiring verification, on its beta version. A magnifying lens icon appearing alongside the message prompted users to search online and verify the content. But since the update has not been rolled out for all users, several messages and videos were still being shared without being flagged in any manner.

"New Delhi: The Government's mobile app Aarogya Setu, developed for tracking coronavirus patients, has become the world's fastest app to reach 5 crore downloads in just 13 days, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on April 14 appealed to people to download the app.
 
""Telephone took 75 years to reach 50 million users, radio 38 yrs, television 13 yrs, Internet 4 yrs, Facebook 19 months, Pokemon Go 19 days. AarogyaSetu, India's app to fight COVID-19 has reached 50 mn users in just 13 days-fastest ever globally for an App,"" Kant said in his tweet.
The Aarogya Setu app alerts people if any person in their vicinity has tested positive for COVID-19.
District administrations have been asking all educational institutions and government departments to push people to download the app. The more people install the app on their phones, the more effective it becomes at identifying through location data and Bluetooth data, which phones have come into close contact with an infected person.
 
The app accesses data of infected persons from the Ministry of Health and alerts people if they have come into contact with a Covid-19 infected person.
According to sources, Tata Consultancy Services is working on testing the app and some of its other aspects while Tech Mahindra and the Mahindra group is working on the next version of this application leveraging data science and next generation technologies such as machine learning.
Tech Mahindra is also working on expanding the reach of Aarogya Setu to all types of phones. The current version of Aarogya Setu app is fit for use on smartphones only.

"New Delhi: The Indian Army has asked its personnel to use the Covid-19 contact-tracing app Aarogya Setu with caution while following all cyber security precautions.
While urging download of the Aarogya Setu app, it advised personnel to avoid it in office premises, operational areas and sensitive locations. Personnel, veterans and families have been asked to cyber security precautions.
 
Aarogya Setu is a mobile app developed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to help citizens identify their risk of contracting Covid-19.
“Existing cyber security policies on usage of mobile phones must be adhered to by army personnel while using the Aarogya Setu app,” the soldiers were informed, said sources.
The Indian Army has asked its personnel to only switch on the location services and bluetooth features of the Aarogya Setu app while visiting public places, or when they are engaged in managing isolation centres, while on call for COVID-19 related assistance to civil authorities and while out of cantonments or military stations for essential administrative duties.
 
They have been told not to disclose their service identity including rank and appointment. The contact list of the user should not contain any reference to rank appointment or service. Army personnel have been advised to keep their mobile operating systems updated and to install antivirus protection on their cell phones.
The Aarogya Setu app has crossed the 5 crore downloads in just the 13 days since it was launched.
The app uses bluetooth, GPS, algorithms and artificial intelligence to notify users of their risk of catching the COVID-19 infection, by tracing the same data from other users of the app. 
 
The app detects other devices with Aarogya Setu installed that come in the proximity of that phone. GPS tracks the location of the user in real time and bluetooth tracks if and when the user comes in close proximity with someone infected by COVID-19. 
If a user comes into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, they will be notified about it in a few days. The app has access to the Government of India’s database of known cases.

"Saad’s dubious hand
The Tablighi Jamaat’s (TJ) reckless and irresponsible conduct in the current coronavirus outbreak has surprised many within the Muslim community. The Tablighis have largely been an apolitical and disciplined lot with a penchant for holding large conclaves where after-life matters are deliberated and discussed. However, of late, TJ has been witnessing an intense power struggle between its chief Maulana Saad Kandhlawi and a powerful lobby consisting of the ‘shoura’ (executive council).
 
Saad, a great-grandson of TJ founder Maulana Illyas, reportedly wanted to be one-up on his rivals and ignored saner voices to defer the Delhi-Nizamuddin congregation. Instead, his supporters ensured crowd mobilisation from southern states like Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Kerala, with disastrous consequences. Maulana Saad's role in the TJ headquarters sharing a wall with the Nizamuddin police station has been as dubious. The police reportedly were regular beneficiaries of food and other goodies coming from the TJ office which blurred their vision to act swiftly and decisively.
 
The rise of Rohan Gupta
After successfully convincing the grand old party to begin working through video-conferencing (something that Rahul Gandhi tried and failed at during his tenure as Congress president), Rohan Gupta, the Congress Party’s social media chairperson, is set to be appointed as the head of a new coordination centre with a similar mandate as Prashant Kishor’s in Uttar Pradesh. The social media, data analytics, research, and communication departments will be answerable to Gupta. This rapid rise is because of his stellar work in managing the war rooms of the Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Rajasthan elections. Considered to be close to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Gupta’s rise signals the hegemonic presence of the Gujarat lobby in the Congress. In the recently-held CWC meeting on April 2, Rohan Gupta was the only non-CWC member who took part.
 
After MP, Rajasthan next?
The coronavirus scare seems to be having little or no impact on the disquiet in the Rajasthan Congress, where chief minister Ashok Gehlot is at loggerheads with his deputy, Sachin Pilot. When prime minister Narendra Modi video-conferenced with CMs, many appeared with their deputies and senior ministers but Pilot was kept out. While Gehlot is trying to take full credit for his handling of the coronavirus crisis in Bhilwara and other places, Pilot is never short of pointing out the shortcomings. The buzz in Jaipur is that a Madhya Pradesh-like political drama is contemplated and a regional party may be floated.
 
BSP leverage in Gwalior-Chambal
There is a sense of anticipation among Bahujan Samaj Party leaders in Madhya Pradesh where byelections to 23 Assembly seats will be held within a few months. The BSP is not a major force in the state but in the Gwalior-Chambal region, where most of the byelections are slated to be held, it has pockets of influence. BSP leaders think both the ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress will go out of their way to accommodate or win the BSP over. It is time for hard bargaining. Is BSP supremo Mayawati keeping tabs?
 
Filmmaker’s overtures
Political circles are intrigued by Pankaj Shankar, an independent filmmaker who is closely identified with the Congress. Of late, however, Shankar has been attacking and abusing Rahul Gandhi with a vengeance on social media platforms. He released a web series mocking and ridiculing the former AICC chief. His fictional account titled Love You Pappu, however, does not even have a fig-leaf to cover his political slant. The teaser giving a glimpse of the work culture in the Congress shows Mahatma Gandhi visiting Pappu’s office and not getting an appointment.
 
Perhaps Shankar is headed for greener pastures. But following the induction of Tom Vadakkan, an AICC media department functionary, the BJP does not seem interested in taking in lowly functionaries whose claim to fame has been “famous for being famous”. Two media-savvy brothers from Pune have also been unsuccessful in selling their loyalty though they adopted different methods.

"Kochi: A 71 year old coronavirus infected man from Mahe died on Saturday morning taking the total number of Covid-19 deaths in Kerala to three. P Mehroof, hailing from Cherukallayi in Mahe under Union Territory of Puducherry was undergoing treatment at government medical college hospital, Kannur.
He had other serious medical complications like kidney disease, hypertension and cardiac issues.
 
He was initially admitted in a private hospital and later shifted to the government medical college after being diagnosed with coronavirus infection.
Mehroof has no foreign travel history and it is not clear from where he got the virus infection.
He is reported to have travelled extensively in few panchayats in Mahe area and attended religious ceremonies and marriage functions during the period of March 15 to 21.
The Covid mortality rate is low in Kerala when compared to other parts of the country and the world. Only two deaths were reported during the period from January 30, when the first case was reported, to April 10.
 
In the other two deaths, reported from Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram , the patients had other serious medical complications like cardiac disease and hypertension.
On Friday, seven new Covid cases were reported from the state while 27 patients have been recovered and discharged from hospitals. The total number of confirmed cases is 364 of whom 124 have been recovered.

"I was speaking yesterday to a friend from Bangalore who has lived in the United States for most of his life. He is employed by a software firm and his work requires him to travel to India three times a year. I have known him for about a quarter century and he has been coming with regularity. It has been his routine and he spends at least 60 days each year in India on work.
However, he will not be coming to Bangalore next month, as he was supposed to do, and he does not know when he would next be sent. Companies and businesses will not put their employees at risk any time soon, especially those firms based in America and Europe. They have laws which individuals can use if they feel they have been endangered and their safety jeopardised by their employer. Till there is a vaccine for Covid-19, this situation will remain uncertain.
 
Of course, this will have an impact on the airlines. Already there is a ban on international travel pretty much across the world. Europeans cannot go to America and vice versa. No passenger flights are operating in India. Even when the lockdown is opened in mid April, the number of people flying on work internally will be low and after an initial couple of days when those who are stuck go immediately to where they need to be, the traffic will be lower each month than it was last year.
How will airlines, which operate on very thin margins and sometimes operate at a loss as we have seen in India, manage? They will not be able to and the state will need to decide whether to bail them out (meaning tax payer money to be used on airplane leases and pilot and crew salaries) or let them die. From a position where India was about to sell its national carrier, Air India, we are faced with the possibility that the government buys stakes in a few more and possibly all airlines.
 
Tourism employs something like 10 per cent of the world’s population. My friend stays in a hotel in Bangalore and that place will also lose income from business travellers for the foreseeable future. Restaurants will be hit for the new few months as people will continue remaining home unless absolutely required to be in public spaces. Similarly, malls and cinema halls and all those sorts of places which have high levels of mingling and crowds will suffer crushing losses of revenue. How will we cope and what will our new economy look like? We do not know at this point and we will need to learn as we go along.
 
The chief economist of HDFC bank has written this week that the cost of Covid 19 to the Indian economy will be $100 billion, or Rs 7.5 lakh crore. That is equal to what India spends on defence plus all central government schemes (MNREGA, education, health, PM Awas, Smart Cities, Swachch Bharat, Mid Day meals, drinking water, irrigation etc) combined. Meaning that either we do not spend on all these things, which is not possible, or we borrow or print the money required to do all this.
It is hard to imagine a sector which will not be violently affected by the health crisis, the lockdown and what will come after. The sales for cars and automobiles in March were 50 per cent lower in India than they were in March 2019. This is despite the fact that we lost only about eight days due to the lockdown that month. In April the hit will be bigger because half the month is part of the lockdown. Power consumption was 25 per cent lower this week than in April 2019. This is entirely because factories are shut down and will lose three weeks of output at least. After that, they will hope that their workers return from villages and that is not going to happen soon.
 
There are three or four estimates on what the cost to the Gross Domestic Product of India will be. The most positive one says that we will lose two per cent points of GDP growth. The most negative says we will lose four per cent. The truth is that nobody knows at the moment what will come in April and May, just as nobody anticipated in February that March would turn out the way that it did though the Coronavirus story was already in the headlines then.
It will occupy the world for the rest of 2020 and perhaps even beyond that and will have medium and long-term ramifications. The short term ones, the ones that we have described above, are immediate and visible. But there will be others, especially on the future of the global economy, that may impact us for an entire generation. Because we are currently in the middle of the immediate health crisis, there has not been much discussion of this so far but it will start soon.
 
It is a very difficult task ahead for the prime minister and for the nation, even after the lockdown ends.

"Chennai: WhatsApp on Tuesday put spokes in the ever-turning wheel of misinformation by restricting forwards to just one chat at a time. The update has come to India first, in an indication of how widely the platform is being used to spread unverified information in the country. It will soon be rolled out globally.
Similarly in August 2018, WhatsApp limited forwarding to five chats after the platform found it was being used extensively in India to spread misinformation, fake news and propaganda.
 
The app, which has 2 billion users worldwide introduced the curbs globally around January 2019. NDTV reported that WhatsApp claimed the restrictions led to a 25 per cent decrease in forwards globally.
The report also cited consulting firm Kantar as having found a 40 per cent increase in WhatsApp usage as COVID-19 began spreading globally. The messaging app owned by Facebook was reported to have made the “greatest gains” in usage among social media apps.
Now, with fake news threatening to derail efforts to combat the deadly coronavirus pandemic, WhatsApp, which has 400 million users in India, has introduced the stricter curbs in the country.
 
However, one can still use the forward option several times to send a message to multiple users or copy a message and paste it to various chats.
To ensure that users got only authoritative information on COVID-19, WhatsApp had recently collaborated with the Government of India to create a chat bot to answer queries.
Earlier, in August, WhatsApp added a ‘Forwarded’ label to messages that were not composed by a close contact of the user.

"India is in lockdown until April 15 and the city of Punjab saw the most drastic effect of air pollution reduction.
The picturesque snow-clad mountain range was visible for the first time in Jalandhar on Friday, over a week since the lockdown was imposed on the midnight of March 24.
 
The Dhauladhar mountain range, part of the Himalayan range in Himachal Pradesh, became visible in Jalandhar after years as pollution dipped across Punjab.
As more and more residents laid eyes on the entire Himalayan range from their rooftops, social media was filled with some delightful images.
Ace Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh took to his twitter to express his joy about the same.
Indeed it was a sight to behold for all the punjab residents and its something to cherish forever.

"With the cult classic film Hera Pheri completing 20 years after its release in March 2000, the buzz about a series revival is stronger than ever before. Starring Paresh Rawal as Baburao with Akshay Kumar and Suniel Shetty as Raju and Shyam, the film got two action heroes into comic roles, doing everything unheroic on screen and yet managing to entertain the audience.
“I cannot fathom the kind of response I still get about the film,” reminisces Suniel Shetty, who confirms that a remake is in the works. “The film is happening for sure. I won’t know when,” he had told us recently.
 
“The first part had both of us, action heroes, doing comedy for the first time. We were shooting for the film in Chennai and we wrapped the film in a single location in a lockdown kind of situation —that is how director Priyadarshan works,” the actor further reveals.
If one recalls, the second part never came close to being as funny as the original as most of the actors in the film tried to get loud and get the plaudits that only Baburao got in the film.
Producer Firoz Nadiadwala — who last made Welcome Back — was last speaking to both Priyadarshan as well as Ahmed Khan to see who could direct the third part. Priyadarshan had directed the first part while Neeraj Vora directed the second part. Neeraj was to direct the third part of the film, but he expired. Earlier in 2015, they had planned the film with a partial change in cast with Dostana duo John Abraham and Abhishek Bachchan stepping in along with Suniel playing Ghanshyam, and Paresh retaining his Baburao slot. However, that did not happen.

"Saloni’s twitter account has 98.3k followers and this charming college student’s impersonation of Kangana Ranaut who she wickedly calls Kangana ‘'Runnout’, has earned her 34.7k likes on Twitter. “I hope she likes it too. I have seen Queen multiple times and I believe Kangana is a great actress,” she quickly adds.
It is Kangana, who by default paved the way for Saloni’s foray into comic videos. “I used to mimic her in school and my friends loved it,” she concedes. This youngster straddles dual worlds. She studies economics and political science by day at her university and recedes into her hostel, to make comic videos. “Initially I only did voiceovers but one day a random video I made went viral and my friends suggested that I should show my face. So I bought this wig from Amazon as a part of my get up and everybody loved it. Everyone was making videos. When I joined insta I noticed that Mallika Dua was making videos. I did not know how to channel my thoughts into a video. My brother Shubham, who has appeared in Amazon Prime’s Hostel Days and he’s a Youtuber, guided me.”
 
And that is how the demure housewife with fierce views became an instant hit. And the biggest high for her was, “When Kusha Kapila messaged me after seeing my video. I was on cloud nine that day,” she says.
Nazma Aapi airs her views nonchalantly on everything from panic buying post corona virus to a desi mother-in-law’s views post lockdown. Like actress Sonam, who Saloni recently impersonated and even got an appreciated response back, the young sensation has the ability to laugh at herself. Recounting an older video on Delhi’s air pollution, she laughingly admits, “I look very poor in that video. I stay at a hostel in Delhi. I opened the door, it was so hazy, I just woke up, did not wash my face, used my phone camera and started shooting. I look so pathetic.”
 
You’ve got to hand it to Saloni. She exudes remarkable self confidence when she says, “People ask me why I don’t apply make up? So when I mimicked Sonam I put on the best kurta I had, to do justice to Sonam as she is a fashion icon. But Nazmi aapi does not require a makeover,” asserts the girl who also doubles up as the background guy who comments in her videos. I am the guy in the background, I can imitate Jimmy Shergil too, so decided to do the male voice over.”
Saloni who hails from UP modestly states she is not famous in her hometown but wickedly adds that her relatives are wary of her as she might just mimic them. “My nani refuses to speak in front of me as she is afraid that I will imitate her also,” she laughs.
 
Saloni happily admits that none of her videos have generated any hate mails or comments. “I am very balanced and take care not to offend anyone in my social commentary.”
The future looks bright as Saloni is currently doing collaborative videos and ads and will be venturing into radio soon. Speaking about the process of creating, Saloni says that working on filmi impersonations does not take time but when she dons the garb of Nazma Aapi, it takes her 2.5 hours to work on the script and shoot. “My parents are supportive. They told me to not target anybody and that is something that I am cautious about. My brother too was very supportive.”

"Billionaire technology entrepreneur Elon Musk had recently taken to the microblogging site to tweet, “Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.”
Even though the Government of India, recently, prohibited the export of surgical masks and ventilators because of its shortage in hospitals, the uber-rich are panic-buying and hoarding ventilators at home at the cost of Rs 10 lakh. Ventilators are used for patients suffering from coronavirus to keep them alive if they struggle to breathe.
 
But is this a sensible move? Experts including Dr Sundeep Lakhtakia, who is a senior consultant at Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, feel otherwise. “This is sheer stupidity and waste of resources. It’s like buying a fighter jet for whenever we may have a war even when one does not know how to fire a missile, let alone fly a plane,” he says.
To begin with, those buying/hoarding a ventilator tend to forget that they will still need someone to manage the machine at home. Moreover, where will they find the necessary therapist or doctor to run the ventilator if it comes to that? For those wondering if it is, in the first place, possible to run a critical care patient privately at home especially in the Indian scenario, Dr Khizar Raoof, Consultant Urologist, Olive Hospital, shares his thoughts. “Unless they have an intensivist — a specialist doctor handling ICUs  — at home, it’s of no use. We just don’t have enough staff to run hospitals, let alone home ventilators,” he cautions. Adding to the above thought, Dr Sunil Kapoor, senior Interventional Cardiologist, Apollo Hospitals, says, “It needs to be connected to a high-pressure oxygen line, which is available only in the ICCU of hospitals.”
 
Procedure and infrastructure
In addition to the above, ventilator settings also must be monitored and changed as per the patient’s need, depending on the patient’s condition. What’s more, the patient must be appropriately sedated to tolerate the ventilator. So essentially, the issue here is about how to set it up.
“Adjustment of a ventilator is an hourly issue,” explains Dr Chaitanya Challa, Challa Nursing Home. “A doctor has to be constantly present to adjust it. Buying an oxygen concentrator at home is acceptable, but a ventilator at home is not feasible. Ventilators also need an oxygen supply and compressed air, which is again not possible at home.”
 
According to Dr K. Subba Reddy, Sr Consultant Critical Care, Apollo Health City, ventilating a patient requires the entire intensive care infrastructure. “Just buying ventilators and keeping them ready outside ICU settings is not advisable. Sometimes, they may require prolonged ventilator support,” he adds. “Further, they require good doctors and nurses to take care of them. They may also require other organ support such as dialysis and multiple other consultants’ involvement. Added to it all, they will require very close monitoring to wean off the ventilator. So, it is not possible to create efficient ICUs at home.”
 
Other valid concerns
In government-run hospitals, it is very difficult to get vacant ventilators. In private hospitals, ventilators are available but are highly priced. So also, experts think it unwise and warn against anyone getting into an unnecessary panic-buying of ventilators during this time.
“In the Indian scenario, if things go worse, the government will take over all the ventilators. Even the ones in private hospitals,” warns Dr Khizar Raoof. “They’re already getting private medical colleges ready, and if the need arises, private hospitals will also become a part of the war against corona.”
 
Dr Sunil Kapoor also reminds people that very few of the corona patients need ventilators in the first place.
“COVID-19 infection results in respiratory distress syndrome in only 2-4 per cent of people. For instance, as of now, there are 40 patients admitted in the COVID-19 ward of the Gandhi Hospital and not a single patient is on ventilator,” elaborates Dr Sunil Kapoor.

"India is in lockdown until April 15 and the city of Punjab saw the most drastic effect of air pollution reduction.
The picturesque snow-clad mountain range was visible for the first time in Jalandhar on Friday, over a week since the lockdown was imposed on the midnight of March 24.
 
The Dhauladhar mountain range, part of the Himalayan range in Himachal Pradesh, became visible in Jalandhar after years as pollution dipped across Punjab.
As more and more residents laid eyes on the entire Himalayan range from their rooftops, social media was filled with some delightful images.
Ace Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh took to his twitter to express his joy about the same.
Indeed it was a sight to behold for all the punjab residents and its something to cherish forever.

"With the cult classic film Hera Pheri completing 20 years after its release in March 2000, the buzz about a series revival is stronger than ever before. Starring Paresh Rawal as Baburao with Akshay Kumar and Suniel Shetty as Raju and Shyam, the film got two action heroes into comic roles, doing everything unheroic on screen and yet managing to entertain the audience.
“I cannot fathom the kind of response I still get about the film,” reminisces Suniel Shetty, who confirms that a remake is in the works. “The film is happening for sure. I won’t know when,” he had told us recently.
 
“The first part had both of us, action heroes, doing comedy for the first time. We were shooting for the film in Chennai and we wrapped the film in a single location in a lockdown kind of situation —that is how director Priyadarshan works,” the actor further reveals.
If one recalls, the second part never came close to being as funny as the original as most of the actors in the film tried to get loud and get the plaudits that only Baburao got in the film.
Producer Firoz Nadiadwala — who last made Welcome Back — was last speaking to both Priyadarshan as well as Ahmed Khan to see who could direct the third part. Priyadarshan had directed the first part while Neeraj Vora directed the second part. Neeraj was to direct the third part of the film, but he expired. Earlier in 2015, they had planned the film with a partial change in cast with Dostana duo John Abraham and Abhishek Bachchan stepping in along with Suniel playing Ghanshyam, and Paresh retaining his Baburao slot. However, that did not happen.

"Saloni’s twitter account has 98.3k followers and this charming college student’s impersonation of Kangana Ranaut who she wickedly calls Kangana ‘'Runnout’, has earned her 34.7k likes on Twitter. “I hope she likes it too. I have seen Queen multiple times and I believe Kangana is a great actress,” she quickly adds.
It is Kangana, who by default paved the way for Saloni’s foray into comic videos. “I used to mimic her in school and my friends loved it,” she concedes. This youngster straddles dual worlds. She studies economics and political science by day at her university and recedes into her hostel, to make comic videos. “Initially I only did voiceovers but one day a random video I made went viral and my friends suggested that I should show my face. So I bought this wig from Amazon as a part of my get up and everybody loved it. Everyone was making videos. When I joined insta I noticed that Mallika Dua was making videos. I did not know how to channel my thoughts into a video. My brother Shubham, who has appeared in Amazon Prime’s Hostel Days and he’s a Youtuber, guided me.”
 
And that is how the demure housewife with fierce views became an instant hit. And the biggest high for her was, “When Kusha Kapila messaged me after seeing my video. I was on cloud nine that day,” she says.
Nazma Aapi airs her views nonchalantly on everything from panic buying post corona virus to a desi mother-in-law’s views post lockdown. Like actress Sonam, who Saloni recently impersonated and even got an appreciated response back, the young sensation has the ability to laugh at herself. Recounting an older video on Delhi’s air pollution, she laughingly admits, “I look very poor in that video. I stay at a hostel in Delhi. I opened the door, it was so hazy, I just woke up, did not wash my face, used my phone camera and started shooting. I look so pathetic.”
 
You’ve got to hand it to Saloni. She exudes remarkable self confidence when she says, “People ask me why I don’t apply make up? So when I mimicked Sonam I put on the best kurta I had, to do justice to Sonam as she is a fashion icon. But Nazmi aapi does not require a makeover,” asserts the girl who also doubles up as the background guy who comments in her videos. I am the guy in the background, I can imitate Jimmy Shergil too, so decided to do the male voice over.”
Saloni who hails from UP modestly states she is not famous in her hometown but wickedly adds that her relatives are wary of her as she might just mimic them. “My nani refuses to speak in front of me as she is afraid that I will imitate her also,” she laughs.
 
Saloni happily admits that none of her videos have generated any hate mails or comments. “I am very balanced and take care not to offend anyone in my social commentary.”
The future looks bright as Saloni is currently doing collaborative videos and ads and will be venturing into radio soon. Speaking about the process of creating, Saloni says that working on filmi impersonations does not take time but when she dons the garb of Nazma Aapi, it takes her 2.5 hours to work on the script and shoot. “My parents are supportive. They told me to not target anybody and that is something that I am cautious about. My brother too was very supportive.”

"Billionaire technology entrepreneur Elon Musk had recently taken to the microblogging site to tweet, “Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.”
Even though the Government of India, recently, prohibited the export of surgical masks and ventilators because of its shortage in hospitals, the uber-rich are panic-buying and hoarding ventilators at home at the cost of Rs 10 lakh. Ventilators are used for patients suffering from coronavirus to keep them alive if they struggle to breathe.
 
But is this a sensible move? Experts including Dr Sundeep Lakhtakia, who is a senior consultant at Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, feel otherwise. “This is sheer stupidity and waste of resources. It’s like buying a fighter jet for whenever we may have a war even when one does not know how to fire a missile, let alone fly a plane,” he says.
To begin with, those buying/hoarding a ventilator tend to forget that they will still need someone to manage the machine at home. Moreover, where will they find the necessary therapist or doctor to run the ventilator if it comes to that? For those wondering if it is, in the first place, possible to run a critical care patient privately at home especially in the Indian scenario, Dr Khizar Raoof, Consultant Urologist, Olive Hospital, shares his thoughts. “Unless they have an intensivist — a specialist doctor handling ICUs  — at home, it’s of no use. We just don’t have enough staff to run hospitals, let alone home ventilators,” he cautions. Adding to the above thought, Dr Sunil Kapoor, senior Interventional Cardiologist, Apollo Hospitals, says, “It needs to be connected to a high-pressure oxygen line, which is available only in the ICCU of hospitals.”

"Hyderabad: Sirisha Bandla, 34-year-old aeronautical engineer, is one among the 5 astronauts to fly into space with billionaire Richard Branson on board Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo Unity.
Bandla is also the third Indian-origin woman to head to space after Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams.
 
Born in Andhra Pradesh's Guntur and brought up in Houston, Texas, Bandla will join Branson and four others to make a journey to the space from New Mexico.
""I am so incredibly honored to be a part of the amazing crew of #Unity22, and to be a part of a company whose mission is to make space available to all,"" Bandla tweeted when the mission was announced.
""I really didn't need to tweet this since my friends flooded the feed yesterday with itRed heartI was overwhelmed (in a good way!) by messages of love, unrecognizable capital text, and positivity yesterday. Slowly working my way through them...one platform at a time!"" she added.

Bandla will be astronaut no 004 and her flight role will be Researcher Experience, according to her profile on Virgin Galactic.
""When I first heard that I was getting this opportunity, it was just. I think that that probably captured it very well, I was speechless. This is an incredible opportunity to get people from different backgrounds, different geographies and different communities into space,"" she said in a video posted on Virgin Galactic Twitter on July 6.
 
Speaking about the experience, Bandla said it was ""incredible"" and ""life-changing"" experience to see Earth from space.
""I am kind of still up there but it's so glad to be here. I was trying to think about a better word than incredible but that is the only word that can come to my mind... Seeing the view of Earth is so life-changing but also the boost the rocket motor kicking in. The whole trip to space and back is just amazing, Bandla told the NBC News in an interview.
Bandla described the moment as emotional and said, ""I have been dreaming of going to space since I was young and literally it is a dream come true.""
 
""I have wanted to be an astronaut but I wasn't able to go in the traditional National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) role and I took a very unconventional way to go to space and I do believe that a lot of people are going to be able to experience this and that's why we are here,"" she added.

On being asked if this was just a joyride for rich people, she said, ""As Virgin Galactic builds up...this is VSS Unity's ride to space today but we have got two more spaceships in the manufacture and we hope the cost would come down.""
Virgin Galactic  — the business Branson started in 2004  — aims to fly private citizens to the edge of space. The trips are designed to permit passengers to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and observe the curvature of Earth.
The Virgin Galactic carrier can launch up to eight people (two pilots and six passengers) on the Unity 22 flight, but on Sunday there were only six occupants (two pilots and four passengers).
 
The four mission specialists evaluated different experiences that Virgin Galactic has promised its future customers, many of whom have already reserved trips to space with the company at USD 250,000 a seat.

"Hyderabad: Veteran Bollywood actor Dilip Kumar who breathed his last on Wednesday at the age of 98 had his share of bittersweet memories of Hyderabad. He married a Hyderabadi woman Asma Rahman sometime in 1980, though he was already married to Saira Banu. Dilip Kumar said a conspiracy was hatched that forced him to marry Asma Rahman.
Saira Banu was reportedly not aware of Dilip Kumar’s marriage with Asma. She came to know about it in 1982 when a tabloid made this sensational revelation. Though Saira Banu was pained to hear the news, she stood by Dilip Kumar when he had admitted his mistake and sought her time to undo the wrong through proper legal process and restore the sanctity of their marriage. Later Dilip Kumar divorced Asma.
 
Dilip Kumar had inaugurated the Owaisi Hospital & Research Centre managed by All India Majlis Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen in 1996. At a young age, Dilip Kumar used to visit Hyderabad. He had attended a few functions and wedding ceremonies held in Hyderabad. Dilip Kumar also contributed to the development of the Deccan Medical College.

"Hyderabad: The city’s air is rife with Nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This is contrary to popular belief that the lockdown has helped improve the air quality, an analysis conducted by Greenpeace India Society has found.
Nitrogen dioxide pollution is known to cause damage to the human respiratory tract, cause asthma and make a person vulnerable to other respiratory infections. The study said there was growing evidence that polluted cities suffered disproportionately more from coronavirus cases.
 
Increased concentrations of NO2, Greenpeace said, were found not just in Hyderabad but across several cities in India during the current Covid19 pandemic.
The report published on Wednesday said: “In Hyderabad, nitrogen dioxide air pollution was 69 per cent higher in April 2021 than in the same month the previous year. A part of this difference is attributable to changing weather conditions. After removing the effect of weather, there is still an increase of 38 per cent which is attributed to an increase in emissions.”
After a year since the initial Covid lockdown went into effect, NO2 pollution has increased in eight Indian cities -- Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Lucknow.
 
According to satellite observations, NO2 pollution in Hyderabad increased by 69 per cent between April 2020 and April 2021. The weather had only a little of the contribution to this change. In Delhi, NO2 was higher by 125 per cent, Chennai by 94 per cent Mumbai by 52 per cent, Bengaluru by 90 per cent Kolkata by 11 per cent, Jaipur by 47 per cent and Lucknow by 32 per cent in April 2021 than in the same month the previous year
While there was an opinion that the weather conditions would abate the pollution, the result drawn out in the study showed that despite taking the weather conditions into account,  NO2 pollution occurred. This was primarily due to changes in emissions, while weather influence was only of secondary importance in most places,” it said.
 
According to Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner with Greenpeace India, “The air quality levels in these cities are alarming. People saw clean skies and breathed fresh air during the nationwide lockdown though it was an unintended consequence of the pandemic. The disruption caused by the pandemic is a case for transition to cleaner, equitable and sustainable decentralised energy sources such as rooftop solar and clean and sustainable mobility. The recovery from the pandemic must not come at the expense of a return to previous levels of air pollution.”

Kayamkulam MLA U Pratibha also joined the minister during the launch of the project.
 
This venture comes at a time when tourism, which is a mainstay of Kerala that contributes to 11 per cent to state SDP, incurred loss due to COVID-19.
To overcome the crisis, the Kerala government also has mooted the idea of complete vaccinated tourism and also to find new tourism destinations.
The Tourism Minister said the state has initiated a project in which a new destination will be identified in every Panchayat. There are also projects in the pipeline to develop new heritage and pilgrim tourism destinations to attract maximum domestic travellers.

"New Delhi: “Matrimonial ad by a feminist” is an oxymoron. These advertisements are often sexist and casteist, putting emphasis on attributes like caste, class, height, and the colour of one’s skin, and using salary and other wealth related attributes to appeal to potential matrimonial partners.
However, a matrimonial advertisement “by a feminist” went viral after comedian Aditi Mittal tweeted about it, bringing the advertisement into the limelight.
 
The advertisement read: “Match for opinionated feminist. 30+ educated girl, short hair, piercings, works in the social sector against capitalism. Wanted handsome, well-built, strictly 25-28 years old only son with established business, bungalow/at least 20 acre farmhouse. Should know cooking. No farters/burpers please. Write to curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com.”
The advertisement, obviously fake, was a prank to emphasise the sexist and misogynistic ideology behind matrimonial advertisements. The owners of the email curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com- under the pseudonyms Sakshi, her brother Srijan and her best friend Damyanti- told BBC that it was a prank played on Sakshi for her 30th birthday.
 
""Turning 30 is a milestone, especially because of all the conversation in our society around marriage. As you turn 30, your family and society start putting pressure on you to get married and settle down,"" Srijan said.
However, once the advertisement went viral, it reopened the debate of the sexism and misogyny of matrimonial ads. Though she did receive many positive emails, Sakshi claimed that there were a plethora of hate emails sent her way as the ad hurt a lot of fragile egos, ranging from feminism-bashers to trolls sending death threats over a prank.
 
""You can't say such things out loud. Men ask for tall, slim beautiful brides all the time, they brag about their wealth, but when the tables are turned, they can't stomach it. How could a woman set such criteria?"" She added, ""[The ad] was a satirical statement on this narrative and I assume that the people getting triggered are the same as those who put out these kinds of 'slim, fair, beautiful bride wanted' type of ads in the first place"".
And for those upset by an obvious prank, she asks: ""Do you send such triggered emails to all the sexist, casteist 'bride wanted' adverts that appear in the papers everyday? If not, then you need to curb your patriarchy"".

""It was, in fact, back in 2016, that I first gave proof for the formula improved by the great mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann in the 1800s. I had put it on the web for open review and downloads after working on it for about six weeks. During 2018-19, I gave several lectures on the proof,” Dr Eswaran, 74, who is with the Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Hyderabad, said.
The Riemann Hypothesis, in the simplest possible explanation, relates to how prime numbers are distributed. This has been a problem that has challenged mathematicians for generations. According to mathematicians who have grappled with the hypothesis, proof of the Riemann Hypothesis would have far-reaching consequences for number theory and for the use of primes in cryptography, and would automatically lead to the proof of numerous theorems which are dependent on the truth of this hypothesis.
 
In Dr Eswaran's methodology, the ‘factorisation sequence of numbers’ was shown to be like a 'random walk', he said. ""This method used was actually not just number theories. I had to use techniques from random variables and probability as well,"" Dr Eswaran added.  
An expert committee of scientists including Dr T. Ramasami, former secretary, Union ministry of science and technology, Prof. P. Narasimha Reddy, executive director, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Prof. M. Seetharaman, former professor and Chair, department of theoretical physics, University of Madras, Prof. V. Srinivasan, former professor and dean, School of Physics, UoH, Prof. K. Srinivasa Rao, former senior professor, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, Prof. M. D. Srinivas, senior Fellow, Centre for Policy Studies, Prof. Vinayak Eswaran, department of mechanical and aerospace engineering, IIT Hyderabad, and Dr Adindla Suma, associate professor, department of computer science, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology conducted an open review of the proof for a year from February 2020 to conclude that Dr Eswaran had indeed proved the Riemann Hypothesis.  
 
The committee invited more than 1,200 mathematicians to participate in an open review of the presented proof. The review was open in the sense that the referees had to be willing to have their names and institutional affiliations openly revealed, so that nothing is done anonymously, and nothing can be said that would not be openly available for all other experts to see.
Dr Eswaran said in his experience this had been the most fair and robust way to get the proposed proof assessed. The expert committee then examined the comments of the reviewers and the responses of the author. In their final meeting held on May 16, the committee concluded that Dr Eswaran’s proof of the Riemann Hypothesis is correct.
 
The committee also ruled that the proof, the referees’ comments, and the author’s responses in their entirety, without any redactions, should be published in the form of an e-book and made available to the public at large and then followed, a few months later, by a hard copy.

"ANANTAPUR: Lack of rains yet in parts of Rayalaseema has led to rural people enacting the centuries-old tradition of protesting against the Rain God with “Karuvu Rallu” or drought stones.
As per the tradition, villagers in this drought-prone region throw waste material of their village, including the drought stones, on outskirts of another village to appease the Rain God into showering rains. Villagers, however, exercise caution while throwing the drought stones, lest it lead to a clash with members of the targeted village.
 
All such stones are finally dumped into Penna and other rivers of Rayalaseema bordering Karnataka. Senior citizens say this tradition has been continuing even to this day, as the practise not only appeases the Rain God but also checks farmers from falling into depression due to their inability in raising crops.
This Deccan Chronicle reporter saw a dump of drought stones on outskirts of Seebai village in Kalyanadurgam mandal of Anantapur district. They must have been dumped there by inmates of one of the villages trying to appease the Rain God.
 
Rajanna from Kalayandurgam area said this tradition has been a part of Rayalaseema farmers’ life for many centuries. Karuvu Rallu on outskirts of another village are seen as a positive sign.
Dr. Harinath Reddy of Rayalaseema Vedika says this tradition of protest is mostly seen in villages around Goddess Gangamma temples, which are constructed mostly close to river beds and irrigation tanks. “At these temples, villagers seeking rains offer traditional poojas and ululate to express their grief at lack of rains”, Dr Reddy explained.
 
According to reports available, many areas of Rayalaseema have experienced 72 drought years in the past 145 years. Such high variability in southwest monsoon is an indicator of the risk associated with farming in this district. It has 7 lakh hectares of dry land whose cultivators depend only on seasonal rains.

"Hyderabad: Milkha Singh made waves at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, but his baby steps as a sprinter were taken here in Secunderabad, where he was recruited in the Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (EME) of the Army back in 1952.
The ’Flying Sikh’ died of Covid complications late on Saturday night. He was 91.
 
He trained in and around the EME Centre area, building his strength and stamina by taking up many an uphill task — he would run up the Ammuguda hill carrying a stone-filled bag and also run alongside a train, which ran on the then metre gauge track between Bolaram and Ammuguda. “The driver of a particular train used to encourage and egg me on. It was kind of a motivation and I could run for a longer distance,” Milkha recalled in interviews later.
He has always credited the Army, EME and Secunderabad Cantonment for his sporting success. “Had I not joined the Army I would not have worked so hard,” Milkha said.
 
Fittingly, a colony in the EME Centre is named after him, as also the Stadium inside the EME Centre where he trained. While inaugurating the Milkha Singh Stadium in 2014, the legend had got emotional, kissed the turf and said it was like a gurudwara to him.
Secunderabad, where Milkha lived from 1952 to 1960 and prepared for the 1960 Olympics at which he missed the 400 metres bronze medal by a whisker, was always special to him. “Whenever he came across athletes from Secunderabad/ Hyderabad, he would develop an instant affinity. ‘Mai Secunderabad ka rice khaney ke baad running start kiya’ (I have started running after eating rice in Secunderabad) he once told me in jest. He would also talk about his many memories here,” Prabhakara Rao Mulagala, veteran long-distance runner from the city, told this newspaper.
 
“We should also remember Milkha used to run on cinder tracks, not on the present synthetic ones that give athletes the advantage of up to a second. He was the first to run the 400m under 46 seconds, at a meet in Oslo (Norway) a fortnight or so before the Rome Olympics, where he was unfortunate to finish fourth, 0.1 second behind Malcolm Spence of South Africa. Later, South Africa was banned from sport for 36 years because of apartheid... that bronze could’ve belonged to Milkha, who competed against the world’s best,” added Prabhakara, who has won 300-plus gold medals at national and international races, and at 69 still competes in races.

"Hyderabad: If a scriptwriter had proposed a few years ago a logline for a movie which read – an actor from Punjabi, with a six-pack body, who has played a villain on screen for over two decades, finds a calling in the midst of a pandemic.
His real-life works make him the most beloved superstar across the country, the trust in him built rapidly as he works to connect, first with migrant workers and trying to help them, and as a second wave hits, responding to people from across the country, reaching out to him with a trust they repose in him greater than in governments. And in cineaste Telugu states, gods of decades slide down the charts, downed by a virus, leaving only one real star.
 
Such a script would never have found a director accepting it. Even the audiences would have found it beyond plausibility, even for a story. But when life scripts stories and reality screens it, not for two hours but years, anything is possible. Such has been the script starring Sonu Sood since Coronavirus spread its menacing tentacles and brought down every order of society and all semblances of sanity.
But in dark times, heroes arise from unexpected spots. Lending help, giving hope, sharing light, redefining love, and metamorphosing fan following.
 
Speaking to Deccan Chronicle about his inner motivations to emerge from the fringes of celebritydom to becoming a trusted icon of a ravage nation’s people, Sonu Sood, in a soft soothing voice of a healer rather than a preferred negative actor of the movie screen, said, “growing up in Moga, Punjab, I saw my mother, a teacher, give free tuition classes for decades. Outside my father’s shop, there would always be a langar, where I too would serve food. It was a lesson ingrained for life that you must always be there to serve in whatever capacity you have.”
 
When asked about the incident that prompted him to emerge out of lockdown and pandemic fears to become a frontline hero, Mr Sood said, “last year, when I started hearing stories of migrant workers, I knew I could no longer sit in the security and comfort of my home. As a migrant worker myself, though privileged and lucky, I could empathise with their angst. It started with serving food and giving basic financial help to organising to help them in larger numbers.”
The legend grew quickly because of the vacuum. None of India’s conventional heroes – film stars, cricketers, billionaires – were there to really make a significant difference. Sood’s rise in being recognised as a saviour is also a deep reflection of the indifference of the others.
 
How do you feel about being recognised and trusted so much by people that they tag you on twitter for help before government agencies or ministers? Do you feel pressure to deliver?
He smiles, and in one of the most humane voices I have heard in a long time, replies, “there is no pressure when a friend or family member expects you to stand for them. It is no different. Every bit of time, money and effort I can muster, I am out there because I know somewhere, someone who has reached out to me is waiting and expecting. It is a call I must respond to, and I can’t let them down.”
 
I scratch my head, a bit bewildered. Is it a mere PR exercise? Or did I get connected to Dalia Lama by mistake? It is, I do not think it is his fault that others in the cine world have used charity as a ticket to sell more tickets for their next release. Last year, we were stuck with the tragic story of another SS in Bollywood – Sushant Singh. This SS has risen now to become India’s superhero, without a cape, just a twitter handle.
Are you a bit embarrassed Sonu, I ask him, that others in your film fraternity, Bollywood or Tollywood, who have received greater stardom and earned far more money and influence, never cared to take up work like yours in one of our worst years ever? He answers candidly, but with sangfroid. “You can’t force a feeling of wanting to help people. It can’t even be taught beyond a point. It must come from within.”
 
What next? Will this image harm your film career? Next time any film fans see him on screen as a villain, will the portrayal be convincing? “I am not thinking of the next film. Just my next SOS call.”
He disappears to do good for someone, somewhere. A villain has refined heroism, forever. My vote for the biggest star in films in India in a dark year – Sonu Sood.

"Nellore: The Ayush department team studying the concoction prepared by Bonigi Anandaiah at Krishnapatnam and hawked as a cure for Covid-19 cannot be termed an Ayurvedic medicine.
They said that Ayush protocols and guidelines do not accept these preparations as Ayurvedic drugs. They felt that the preparations were similar to traditional local medicines, hinting that there is no need for any licence.
 
Speaking to this newspaper, Commissioner of Ayush and head of the team, Col. V. Ramulu, said that there are no harmful ingredients in the substance being given by Anandaiah, including the eye drops.
“Anandaiah prepared all them before us and the process is very simple for anyone to produce. Moreover, he is willing to share the formula with the public,” he said.
The Ayush official said that Anandaiah has been using herbs including locally available leaves such as neem, mango and jamun apart from honey, pepper, green camphor, nutmeg, black cumin, turmeric and cinnamon among many other items, “which we use daily for preparing food items.”
 
In the eye drops, Anandaiah has been using pepper, mulla vankaya and honey, Col Ramulu noted. He said that the preparation cannot be prescribed for Covid-19 as the formula is one among hundreds of local remedies for different ailments. Citing an instance, he pointed to the popular Puttur treatment for broken bones.
Col Ramulu said they would submit a report to the government on their study. It is up to the government to take a decision, he added.

"Hyderabad: On turning 43 in May two year ago, Pushpak, a highly successful senior executive with a global fin-tech firm located in the Financial District, made several changes in his lifestyle. These included getting a farm house in the town, buying a new SUV and promising to block his calendar for a family holiday abroad.
His fitness goals included joining a gym, cycling and running. His life revolved around the stress of managing his own wealth portfolio as also his financial goals and ambitions.
 
Two years later, the SUV means far less to him. His farmhouse seems a trifle less important.
He has lost two members in his extended family, a close friend and several friends. He has failed at least in one case; despite all the money, he failed to get an ICU bed for a close relative in another city.
He now has a new priority; having peace of mind. After many trials, he has chosen an unlikely route – meditation – to achieve his goal.
Speaking on the eve of World Meditation Day, Pushpak says, “I knew it but missed the significance of such an elementary truth in life. Life is all about breathing. We breathe, we are alive. For all my life, I took it for granted. Today, anxiety and stress, fear and worry are all taking a toll on my life. Corona has raised questions on what we thought was our success. The calm of being aware of my own breath has been the greatest learning.”
 
He’s alone now. Hordes of people have been forced by the pandemic and its continuing challenges to seek and find mental peace through meditation.
Kamala Chirravuri, one of the top-notch yoga meditation teachers in Hyderabad, has celebrities -- those with serious mental issues and corporate executives -- seeking her help. She offers them counseling and personalized yoga-meditation solutions.
“Meditation as defined by Patanjali comprises dharana and dhyana. Dharana is singularly focusing all our conscious attention on one object, the starting point of meditation. Dhyana is the highest level we can achieve, wherein we are immersed and become one with the flow,” she says.
 
When asked about her heightened interest in meditation, Kamala replies, “It feels like we are in the midst of a mythological pralaya. To face the unrest outside, we must find strength, peace and calm within. Once we learn to focus our attention within, and become aware of our breath, we find a center and we reduce the imbalance that causes stress, anxiety and unrest.”
A trainer in the Krishnamacharya tradition, Kamala is comfortable with the diversity of meditation techniques. “There are many techniques from Vipassana, the focus on breath and sensations, to chanting of ‘Om’ to visualizations. Anything that works for you! But the one constant in life is our breathing.”
 
Sanjay Sehgal, a director at Heartfulness, says, “In our technique, we begin with thought as a focal point and dive deeper into the heart. This is a 76-years-old technique of diving deeper and achieving a higher level of consciousness.”
He says, “People may reach out for various reasons. Relieving your stress or finding peace is easy. I often say, you can find peace with a peg of good whiskey or if you can avoid fighting with your spouse. But finding sustainable inner peace, to be a better person, is harder, which is where we take you to.”
 
The heart-centred meditation, which has millions of practitioners, over 14,000 trainers and over 260 ashrams in 130 nations, renders its service all free.
When quizzed about the recent spurt in interest, Sehgal says, “Even a basic practice of pranayamam will help you at a physical level. It expands your lungs and eases the flow of air from your nose to inside. It can most certainly help during Covid times. Bad things can happen to anyone. But a great gift of meditation is that it helps you alter and find a better sense of control over your own reactions and responses. I have seen in my own family that those who meditate had a distinctly different and qualitatively better response to the emergencies arising out of the Covid pandemic than to those who don’t meditate.”
 
Trainers have adopted technology in the Covid season to ensure that meditation can be taught in the virtual mode. From an institutional meditation like Heartfulness, whose global headquarters is in Hyderabad and whose spiritual leader Daaji has held remote virtual sessions to individual trainers like Kamala, to those who are doing sessions through Zoom or Google Meets, technology is helping bring together the agitated with those who guide you to inner peace.

But finding sustainable inner peace, to be a better person, is harder, which is where we take you to.”
 
The heart-centred meditation, which has millions of practitioners, over 14,000 trainers and over 260 ashrams in 130 nations, renders its service all free.
When quizzed about the recent spurt in interest, Sehgal says, “Even a basic practice of pranayamam will help you at a physical level. It expands your lungs and eases the flow of air from your nose to inside. It can most certainly help during Covid times. Bad things can happen to anyone. But a great gift of meditation is that it helps you alter and find a better sense of control over your own reactions and responses. I have seen in my own family that those who meditate had a distinctly different and qualitatively better response to the emergencies arising out of the Covid pandemic than to those who don’t meditate.”
 
Trainers have adopted technology in the Covid season to ensure that meditation can be taught in the virtual mode. From an institutional meditation like Heartfulness, whose global headquarters is in Hyderabad and whose spiritual leader Daaji has held remote virtual sessions to individual trainers like Kamala, to those who are doing sessions through Zoom or Google Meets, technology is helping bring together the agitated with those who guide you to inner peace.

"HYDERABAD: The air inside is cool, but thick with Coronavirus. Among the 13 patients in a Covid-19 ICU, some are on ventilators as their bodies wracked by the virus try and fight back the disease.
The sight is pathetic. The tube inside the throat adds to their cough. Each time a patient coughs, countless virus particles are spewed into the air.
 
Inside the blue full body protection kits, doctors, nurses and other support staff go about their tasks methodically. At stake are the lives of infected patients who, along with their families, have placed their faith in god the almighty and the hospital staff.
The staff in attendance is practising a new regimen of long shifts on slim meals and controlled fluid intake. “If anyone wants to take a break, they will take off the PPE kits and spend 20 minutes in the restroom and spend another 20 minutes putting on a fresh kit. In the meanwhile, we need to find a replacement for that person for a similar duration,” explained Dr K. Subba Reddy, chief intensivist at Apollo Hospital.
 
Last year, when patients began streaming into the ICU at Apollo in Jubilee Hills, there was fear and apprehension among the staff. Everyone was worried and scared. It was Annapurna, a senior housekeeping staffer, who gave the medics the confidence to carry on.
“I had attended to the requirements of TB, AIDS and Chicken Pox patients. We overcame those situations with courage and we can overcome this too,” she had told them. “That gave us a lot of motivation and strength. Then there was one of our nurses Pyun Su Klin, who lost her sister and brother in the first wave. Yet, she said she will not take a break or go home, but continued to work, saying there were so many pat-ients around to be taken care of,” Dr Subba Reddy recalled. While the stress of working to save lives every minute is itself a challenging experience, so is it that an ICU staffer cannot mingle with own family as a matter of precaution.
 
The air in a Covid-19 ICU is thick with the virus. Intubated patients are coughing, generating aerosols carrying the virus particles.
Subba Reddy, over the past one year, has only been seeing his 11-year-old daughter from a distance, in a different apartment where she lives with her grandparents. Going nearer meant a risk to the child.
Coming off a prolonged 72-hour shift, Dr K. Swarna Deepak, also of Apollo, told Deccan Chronicle on Sunday: “Sometimes you just cannot take a break. Over the last couple of days, we opened more ICUs for Covid patients.”
 
And if a hospital runs out of ventilators, the doctors and nurses would resort to sheer physical stamina, drawing every ounce of strength they have to keep a patient alive.
Using a bag ventilator, they keep pumping, squeezing the bag to push oxygen into a patient’s lungs. “And when one arm gets tired, you just switch arms and continue. As long as it takes,” Dr Deepak said.
Elsewhere, at KIMS hospital, Dr Sambit Sahu, a critical and intensive care specialist, talks wistfully of what the scene was just a few weeks ago. “We barely had three patients in the Covid19 ICU. Then it hit us like a storm. All of a sudden, it was 50 patients; and by the time we realised what was happening, we had a 100 of them in these ICUs,” he said.
 
Unlike last year, Covid19 was a novel disease and what everyone heard about it came from other parts of the world. The second wave is different. There was a sense of mental fatigue, of coming out of a stressful year. “We just got out of a traumatic year. And the feeling as the patients began pouring in was Oh God! Not Again!,” Dr Sahu said.
As the virus keeps flying around in the ICUs, the doctors have just one prayer on their lips; that they be able to save the life of every patient and that people at large followed the safety measures and helped medical professionals by keeping the case loads low.
 
“If that does not happen soon, we are in for a disaster,” said Dr Subba Reddy.

"HYDERABAD: Doctors and nurses attending to Covid-19 patients and posting their videos on social media sum up the trauma they experience in Covid wards, where the pandemic is staging a dance of death and devastation. End of the day, they often break down into tears.
Medical professionals handling the dying patients say counseling their families on the wait outside is itself a huge task and painful experience. Cases are one too many, hospitals are running out of beds, there is shortage of support systems and life-saving equipment, and the virus’s variants are often difficult to identify.
 
The medical staff is face-to-face with death and strained also by the extra hours of work day after day, in iterations. Worse, they are exposed closer to this deadly virus than the general public.
Many doctors, nurses and other medical staff have lost their lives while treating the patients. Here is a war-like situation. They are also scared about the possibility that they carry the killer virus home and spread it to the family.
Alongside comes the people’s irresponsible behavior, couldn’t-care-less attitude, the mass gatherings, political rallies, cinema craze, all helping spread the deadly virus. All these are happening when the frontline Covid warriors are staking their lives and attending to patients non-stop and gasping for breath.
 
Dr Anita Rego, mental health professional and psychotherapist, said: “As frontline workers they deal with the real miseries of the patients, those who are struggling on their beds, those who are breathing their last. The stories of medical success are often clouded by these realities. We need to build an envelope of caring professionals and psychotherapists on whom they can fall back and build their strength and energy.”
She added: “Providing healthcare workers with stronger networks of specialist mental health services is not yet a priority with our health system and we need to advocate it.”
 
Dr Daljeet Kaur, consultant psychiatrist, said: “There will be frustration, stress and anxiety. The medical staff is disheartened because the situation is not in their control. When it comes to the doctors’ level, the coronavirus variants are unpredictable and it is difficult for them to understand the prognosis of patients.”
“The stress level, though, varies between individual and individual. While a senior doctor might be stressed and overwhelmed, a nursing staff or paramedic on the frontline and spending more time with the patient is more depressed seeing the conditions from close quarters.”
 
She suggested: “Counselors should be allocated for patients and the attenders. This will reduce the load of the consulting doctors. The medical staff should also be counseled on a periodical basis. Mental health of the medical staff should be a priority.”

Dr J Shivkumar, senior cardiologist: “The medical professionals are always under stress due to various reasons. Now, in the Covid situation, they are putting their lives on stake and saving the patient, whereas the general public is game with flaunting all the Covid protocols, further straining the health sector facilities.”
 
Dr Ashish Chauhan, Covid care expert at Apollo Hospital: “With an exposure some 100 to 1,000 times more that of the general public, the health care professionals are dead scared while performing their duties. Currently they are working like a soldier, ready to be martyred during a war. A sincere thanks by the patients and their relatives is what they expect.” 
“As per an IMA study, an average Indian doctor lives 10 years lesser than the normal population. Now, some 70 to 80 per cent of the patients are treated and they walkout healthy whereas some 20 to 30 per cent die. This is not an easy sight to digest.”
 
Dr  Karuna Madap, paediatrician, Covid-care: “Health care warriors should protect themselves and their families first. If they are physically and mentally strong, they can take care of hundreds patients. The medical staff should constantly take proper counseling for their mental health from a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist. There should be some organisation to come forward and provide nutritious food for the medical staff.”
Dr Sahithi Reddy Lebaka, junior doctor at Fever Hospital, Nallakunta: “Wearing plastic PPE kits for hours in his summer is not an easy task. Restless extra shifts due to constant patient flow, insufficient medical supplies and instruments, all these mean for us a mental fatigue.”
 
Dr M A Faroqui, professor, PG department of Unani medicine, Tibbi College, Charminar: “On Wednesday, two doctors in this Unani hospital have perished due to Covid-19. Over time, we will be drained out. There has to be equal participation of the public to overcome the present grim situation. When that fails to happen, we become mentally upset.”
Laxman Rudavath, Telangana nursing officers association general secretary: “Nurses are the first to serve patients. Even in these deadly situations, we take care of patients to the best. As we see around too many deaths and when a lot of patients sufferings, we naturally get depressed. We also have a fear that we are taking home the virus to our family.”
 
Jyothi, staff nurse, King Koti Hospital (Covid Centre): “We are exposed to so much of trauma during this pandemic. There is a sudden spike in the cases. When we return home we are out of our mood. Yes, there should be some mental health counselors for the medical workers.”
Sarala Kancharla, staff nursem Gandhi Hospital (State-assigned Covid-19 hospital): “The pouring in of patients, all around us, it’s suffering and suffering…  the shortage of staff, lack of support, our exposure to this deadly virus, the constant fear of us getting infected, we are stressed a lot these days.”
 
Ravindar Reddy, sanitization supervisor: “This wave made many of us think: is this worth taking risk? We are also seeing discrimination near our place, we are very depressed these days, and yet work should go on.”
Haseena Begum, Ayah, Nelofer Hospital: “Seeing the sufferings of patients, especially little children who are infected by coronavirus, makes us more sad and these days we don’t even feel like eating. We all are so scared!”

"New Delhi: Romanian writer-director Radu Jude’s Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn opens with a naughty, kinky pornographic scene. Emi (Katia Pascariu), a school teacher, is having sex with her husband and they are recording the proceedings for a bit of extra thrill.
But somehow the sex tape leaks and is soon making the rounds of giggly WhatsApp groups of her students and their parents. Some download it, purportedly as evidence to beat Emi with. The fact that the sex is consensual, between a husband and wife is irrelevant. There is outrage, and it's mostly about how could a middle-aged, married woman be so raunchy.
 
Radu Jude’s film, which uses this porn clip and the subsequent ""trial"" of Emi in the school’s yard to draw circles around a society's hypocrisy, won the Golden Bear award for Best Film at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Friday.
The film is split in three parts. In the first, Loony Porn walks with Emi as she visits her school principal, goes to a book store and a pharmacy. Shot during the Coronavirus pandemic, this segment has visuals of a city all masked up and wary of social interactions. But it's also a city busy consuming, enraging, eradicating the past.
 
We watch arguments and fights in a supermarket, with owners of big cars who block the sidewalk as a matter of their right. Each clash is an assertion of the entitlement of the rich and marginalisation of others.
The film’s second part is polyphonic and here, through commentary, archival footage, statistics, words, nudes in newspapers, building rising and in ruins, Loony Porn tells the story of Romania — about its role in the Holocaust, its attitude to Jews, Romas, love for dictators, attitude to sex and children. It also tells us that in Romania, 6 out of 10 kids are subjected to family violence.
 
This fact hovers over the film's last segment -- the meeting called by the school principal and parents to interrogate and then vote on Emi’s future. It is kicked off by a parent who insists on playing the sex clip for the benefit of all those gathered.
This scene, framed like an inquisition — the ""accused"" is in the middle, flanked by a judge who will rule based on the mood of the people and the enforcer of morality — is both dark and funny. Though allegations, tangential discussions, innuendoes, inappropriate remarks, shrill sanctimony and, finally, the judgment, Loony Porn lays bare a nation that has revised its history to legitimise its past and current criminal acts and feels emboldened to air its prejudice, bigotry and misplaced rage. Because many speak in the same tongue, collective hypocrisy gets elevated to a sanctimonious, narcissistic chorus.  
 
What's striking is how familiar it all feels. This searing portrait of a nation and its people could well be a day in the life of India.

"The women of today are focused, feisty and raring to go in pursuit of their true calling. And nothing seems to be holding them back. Because she knows exactly what she wants and is growing increasingly immune to petty criticism and stereotypical judgements.
In a fun chat, a bunch of women speak about the inanest comments that came their way when they chose to follow their heart. And what needs to change, as we celebrate another year of Women’s Day!
 
Don’t need sympathy
I am not a propagator of pushing or breaking the glass ceiling. We harp on and on about the fictional glass ceiling. In my opinion, we create our own reality by owning up to our actions. What glass ceiling are we talking about? It has always been a self-fulfilling prophecy. On one hand, we’re always talking about equality and on the other we expect praise for being a woman entrepreneur. Just like you have ‘a boss’ — not a woman boss or a male boss — you’re an entrepreneur, irrespective of gender. The term ‘woman entrepreneur’ is redundant. Your goals don’t know or care about your gender. Just keep going and rise through to where you ought to be.”
Ami Sata, Founder, Amouve
 
Be happy
One should follow their own soul’s calling. I’ve been told I was a dreamer, crazy, irresponsible and ungrounded just because I chose to do what made me happy. Women are questioned a lot more about their choices, and I really hope that changes. Most women today in my opinion are looking for freedom — and being able to do what you like is true freedom.”
Sheelaa Bajaj, Celebrity numerologist
No room for regression
A male acquaintance once said to me, out of the blue, ‘Honestly, Sanhita, I think you are trying too hard. You could have just put on some make-up, and dressed well and got married to a rich guy so that you don’t have to do anything and enjoy a luxurious life’.
I’ve often been asked when is my Chick Lit book coming out. This women’s day I wish we are inclusive of all genders when we make decisions. But above all, I wish that we are able to create a safe society which is more accepting of all kinds of people so that in the future we no longer need to celebrate a certain day to remind people of what more needs to be done to benefit us all.”
Sanhita Baruah,best-selling author of The Art of Letting Go in Amazon’s poetry category, 2020
 
Take charge of your life
I have heard many comments like ‘That’s interesting! What else do you do?’ Another regular comment is, ‘You must not be married. That’s why you are able to do all this. See how things change after marriage...’.
Truth is I’ve been married for 10 years now. My wish for every woman is to be able to take charge of their lives and be aware of their own capabilities, irrespective of people’s perceptions about them or what they do.”
Shambhavi Singh, (Runs Kaushalya.mantra, a wellness start-up, focuses on holistic health)
 
Freedom from bias
It’s high time people start to take fledgling women entrepreneurs seriously. I was once told that I could enjoy and have fun in life on the pretext of ‘entrepreneurship.’ These were their exact words, ‘No one will even question you. But if you are really serious, then let me tell you, building a sustainable business is not everyone’s cup of tea.’
So, from my experience, when women talk about wanting and finding freedom, it actually starts with the need for freedom against bias and stereotyping.”

But above all, I wish that we are able to create a safe society which is more accepting of all kinds of people so that in the future we no longer need to celebrate a certain day to remind people of what more needs to be done to benefit us all.”
Sanhita Baruah,best-selling author of The Art of Letting Go in Amazon’s poetry category, 2020
 
Take charge of your life
I have heard many comments like ‘That’s interesting! What else do you do?’ Another regular comment is, ‘You must not be married. That’s why you are able to do all this. See how things change after marriage...’.
Truth is I’ve been married for 10 years now. My wish for every woman is to be able to take charge of their lives and be aware of their own capabilities, irrespective of people’s perceptions about them or what they do.”
Shambhavi Singh, (Runs Kaushalya.mantra, a wellness start-up, focuses on holistic health)
 
Freedom from bias
It’s high time people start to take fledgling women entrepreneurs seriously. I was once told that I could enjoy and have fun in life on the pretext of ‘entrepreneurship.’ These were their exact words, ‘No one will even question you. But if you are really serious, then let me tell you, building a sustainable business is not everyone’s cup of tea.’
So, from my experience, when women talk about wanting and finding freedom, it actually starts with the need for freedom against bias and stereotyping.”

"Hyderabad: First there were the mice, and some rats. Then came Syrian hamsters and the rabbits. And finally there were the rhesus macaque monkeys. The lakhs of people receiving Covaxin to keep themselves safe from Covid-19, and to help stop the spread of the disease in India and elsewhere in the world, have much to thank these animals for.
Not just because these animals were the first ones to receive the jabs of the three vaccine candidates developed by scientists at the Bharat Biotech, along with Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).
 
Not just because the animals were deliberately injected with the SARS-CoV-2 to test the efficacy of the candidate vaccines while in their cages in a high security Level 4 biosafety hazard lab at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.
But because at the end of the study periods, each of them was put to sleep for ever before necropsies were performed on their bodies by the scientists who studied what the virus did to the animals and their organs, and how the vaccine candidates worked in controlling the virus in their bodies.
All these animals, unknown to anyone outside of the NIV lab or the scientists involved in the vaccine development — in human terms — made the ultimate sacrifice of giving up their lives so the very humans who put them through the trials, could keep themselves safe from the virus that probably racked their fragile bodies as the vaccines and the virus battled it out in their organs.
 
In three studies, scientists from Bharat Biotech, NIV and ICMR provide great detail about how the trial were conducted, and how the immune response for the candidate vaccines — three versions of the then under-development (during the peak of the lockdown in 2020) Bharat Biotech’s vaccine — was in these animals.
There is a reason why lab grown rats, mice, Syrian hamsters, and rabbits are chosen for the studies. As is also the case with the rhesus macaques. The manner in which the immune responses to a virus in these animals develop, is very close to how a human body responds to a virus. And therein lies the value of testing vaccine candidates on these animals even if it means injecting them with the virus to study how their bodies respond and how the vaccines work in controlling the virus in them.
 
Once the trial is over, even if it is possible to extract tissue samples from various organs without actually killing the animals, their subsequent upkeep and nursing them back to health is a hard task. Since these animals are bred for the express purpose of testing in labs, with the exception of the monkeys, and once the tests are completed they are of no further use for any other tests, they are put to sleep in the most humane way possible, according to a senior scientist well versed with the strict protocols that govern use of animals in labs for such tests.
 
While the rats, mice, rabbits and Syrian hamsters were lab-bred, the rhesus macaques that were used in testing Covaxin candidates were caught in the wild in Maharashtra.
According to the study on the tests conducted on the monkeys, permission from the Office of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Maharashtra state, was obtained for capturing 30 rhesus macaques from the wild. Because a decline in the macaque population was observed in the permitted areas of Maharashtra due to the habitat change “probably imposed by food scarcity during the Covid-19 lockdown period of India (March 25, 2020, till May 31, 2020),” 20 of them — 12 males and 8 females — “were captured using experienced monkey catchers,” the study reported. The research was conducted in compliance with the guidelines laid down by the Committee for the Purpose of Control And Supervision of Experiments on Animals, Government of India, the study said.

"New Delhi: Evil is beguiling, evil geniuses more so. They excite us like tantalising puzzles that we want to examine and solve.  
Writers, film directors, theatre owners and audiences are almost like law enforcement officers in their pursuit to understand psychopaths and that’s why they keep revisiting terrorists, serial killers, rapists -- for yet another peek into their minds, their homes, their rage, and their crimes.
 
But, psychopaths are also cliches.
Almost every exploration of a criminal mind that's been mounted on the big screen or split into episodes for OTT platforms is a trek down a familiar road. En route there are absentee or overbearing parents. Some physical or emotional abuse. There’s unease in mundane, social situations. Solace in solitude. And there’s almost, always, sexual frustration.
Given this template, there is nothing exceptional in the story of Theodore Kaczynski, or as he is better known, Ted Kaczynski, America’s Unabomber. And yet, writer-director Tony Stone’s film Ted K, which had its world premiere at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Monday, stands out.
 
To tell the story of the Unabomber, Stone uses real television clips, Kaczynski’s writings, diary entries — which were copious and in numerical code — and meshes them with an intense, bravura performance by Sharlto Copley.
The South African actor, known for his performance as Wikus van der Merwe in the 2009 science fiction film District 9, carries Ted K with a meticulously studied but intense act that is as discomforting as it is impressive.
He remains in an unrelenting wired state throughout, whether he is raging against the whirring helicopters overhead, the pillage of the earth around him, building a bomb or complaining to a telephone company official about the $5 and few cents that a public phone owes him.
 
We watch, in his body and face, as his complexes, sense of superiority, frustration turn into a raging, mad desire to seek revenge on corporates, technology, one parcel bomb at a time.
Great performances, especially in biopics, are marked by that moment when the actor becomes the character, embodying and portraying all the ugliness and physicality while creating an inner cosmos that we can read in their eyes, in the tiniest change of expression.
Copley as Kaczynski, a mathematics prodigy who joined Harvard University at the age of 16 but then checked out to live by himself in Montana mountains in a 10-by-12 wood cabin, is on the screen throughout. Except for a few brief scenes in the 120-minute film, the camera stays on Copley and there is not a single false note in his compelling act.
 
Among the younger lot in Hollywood, Christian Bale, Leonado de Caprio, Matthew McConaughey, Javier Bardem, Joaquin Phoenix, James Franco and Bradley Cooper are names taken with reverence in terms of how much they give of themselves to a role.
Difficult films with demanding roles can ride on them.
To that hall of fame, Ted K adds the name of Sharlto Copley. He creates the sort of scary, uneasy portrait of a man in constant distress and rage that won’t ever leave you.

"Hyderabad: In the rapidly evolving field of healthcare protocols and advancements in treatments of various diseases and health conditions, two city doctors have been digging deep, down to the genetic information level, in a bid to ensure best possible outcomes for their patients.
“This is the next step in medical care,” says Dr Kalyan Uppuluri, from K&H Personalized Medicine Clinic. He, along with Dr Hima Challa, are the founders of the clinic, the first of its kind in the country to offer services bringing genomic medicine into clinical medicare. Armed with degrees in medical genomics from Stanford University and Harvard Medical School respectively, they say they took a leap of faith two years ago to set up their clinic in the city.
 
“There is enough data at the genetic level of humans to help modern medicine become more precise,” says Dr Hima Challa. “There is very strong objective evidence for this.”
The challenge for them was to translate molecular biology level data into medical language. A team of molecular biologists armed with advanced degrees dug deep into published research and after studying thousands of research papers, gathered data on around 8,000 genes and switched what each of them do and what that means in medical language. “For example, the gene that regulates glycogen provides information on how glucose is released when needed by the body. If there are disorders associated with this, this can be determined by genetic studies. If a person is prone to this problem, then advise can be given that he or she needs to consume carbohydrates before exercises or workouts so energy is available for these tasks,” Dr Hima Challa explained.
 
Genomic medicine helps in determining risk scores for various possible health conditions and these scores remain more or less stable through one’s life. Clinical risk scores can change, and can be changed for the better based on follow up advice from physicians, especially when coupled with knowledge of the genetic risk scores, she says.
“Our view is that personalized medicine is the future. Patients will be in a position, when their doctors have the assistance of genomic medicine, to be assured that they are in a position to achieve the best possible outcomes for their treatment,” says Dr Kalyan Uppuluri.
 
Medicines of the future will evolve based on genomics, he predicts. “We see this already in oncology, for treating cancers. Genomics is already helping in attacking this disease’s pathways,” he says.
On what the future holds, he says that they see their clinic offering their products based on algorithms developed based on genetic information they have complied as well as from their patients so far, to support clinics and hospitals. If clinical medicine is combined with genomic medicine and with proper follow-ups by patients, the treatment outcomes will be much better, help patients overcome their disease and help their doctors prescribe protocols that can better combat their conditions, he says.

"Hyderabad: A recently launched biography of the late N.T. Rama Rao, titled 'Maverick Messaiah', written by journalist Ramesh Kandula, chronicles and analyses the political life of NTR and its impact on both the state and the nation. An objective assessment of the late leader, the book has been well-received for its critical insight and diligent research.
What set NTR apart from later day movie stars entering politics? Is the Telugu Desam a Kamma party meant to empower the community and is it dying? In this two-part interview with Sriram Karri, author Kandula defends the party and explains what set NTR apart.
 
Why did NTR remain the last real actor phenomenon to achieve political success? Tamil superstar Rajanikant has now announced he won’t enter politics, while Chiranjeevi and Pawan Kalyan had great fan networks but could not convert them into political parties that could debut with electoral wins.
Film actors who entered politics in the past, especially M.G. Ramachandran (MGR) and later on, N.T. Rama Rao (NTR), had a strong artistic urge to connect with the people. The social bonding they enjoyed with their audiences was qualitatively different from actors who strayed into politics in recent years. Despite enormous adulation they enjoyed, neither MGR nor NTR took the people for granted when entering politics. Unlike MGR, NTR did not have a political pedigree, but spared no effort in understanding and articulating public issues that impacted the masses.
 
Chiranjeevi enjoyed many advantages but failed to convince the voting public that he was an alternative to the existing set-up. His campaign began with an assumption that he was a chief-minister-in-waiting and he had to just walk through elections to occupy the chair.
While NTR used his celluloid image to reach out to the public, he never relied on his glamour alone. The political content of NTR’s campaign was more focused and serious, while Chiranjeevi’s was more style than substance. I think Pawan Kalyan also suffers from the same failings (as his brother). Actors cannot succeed in politics unless they carry a serious political message.
 
Did the kind of films NTR played, particularly mythologies, give him any advantage? Why did he have such high credibility with masses? What in your estimate justifies calling him a messiah of any kind, even if of a maverick kind?
An interesting aspect of NTR's mythologies were that they were pan-Indian stories, and not directly related to Telugu nationalism and pride that NTR propounded politically. During NTR’s time, screen adaptations of mythologies became known for a distinctive Telugu, which was formal and ceremonial. As several researchers have pointed out, NTR's mastery over language, considered a quintessential Telugu experience, did help in his emergence as a Telugu cultural symbol.
 
My hypothesis is that NTR carried over the linguistic identity of these films into his political campaign, but not his screen 'divinity'. His political credibility was not a by-product of his playing godly characters. He worked towards it consciously both in his film career and later on in politics.
As for the tag of messiah, NTR burst on to the political scene in 1982 as a ray of hope and captivated the imagination of the Telugus like no other leader. His campaigns were the greatest spectacles of democracy in action. Shortcomings notwithstanding, NTR emerged as a larger-than-life personality and brought a sea-change in the socio-political landscape of AP.
 
The maverick apart, NTR was a man of strange contradictions. He believed in the power of people, but his democratic credentials were suspect because he had no qualms in turning his party into a one-man show. He was secular to the core but exhibited a peculiar religious streak. He entered politics on the plank of regionalism but remained a committed nationalist throughout.
How did people relate to his dramatics and eccentricities?
His dramatics entertained the masses but some sections of people intensely disliked the theatrics he brought into politics. He carried this urge to be the centre of attraction from reel to public life. However, common folks were not particularly put off by this, because of his ability to convey seriousness of intent. Despite the nickname 'Drama Rao', NTR was a very serious man in private and rarely cracked a joke. But a common person felt warmth in his presence.

"Hyderabad: Sirisha Bandla, 34-year-old aeronautical engineer, is one among the 5 astronauts to fly into space with billionaire Richard Branson on board Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo Unity.
Bandla is also the third Indian-origin woman to head to space after Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams.
 
Born in Andhra Pradesh's Guntur and brought up in Houston, Texas, Bandla will join Branson and four others to make a journey to the space from New Mexico.
""I am so incredibly honored to be a part of the amazing crew of #Unity22, and to be a part of a company whose mission is to make space available to all,"" Bandla tweeted when the mission was announced.
""I really didn't need to tweet this since my friends flooded the feed yesterday with itRed heartI was overwhelmed (in a good way!) by messages of love, unrecognizable capital text, and positivity yesterday. Slowly working my way through them...one platform at a time!"" she added.

Bandla will be astronaut no 004 and her flight role will be Researcher Experience, according to her profile on Virgin Galactic.
""When I first heard that I was getting this opportunity, it was just. I think that that probably captured it very well, I was speechless. This is an incredible opportunity to get people from different backgrounds, different geographies and different communities into space,"" she said in a video posted on Virgin Galactic Twitter on July 6.
 
Speaking about the experience, Bandla said it was ""incredible"" and ""life-changing"" experience to see Earth from space.
""I am kind of still up there but it's so glad to be here. I was trying to think about a better word than incredible but that is the only word that can come to my mind... Seeing the view of Earth is so life-changing but also the boost the rocket motor kicking in. The whole trip to space and back is just amazing, Bandla told the NBC News in an interview.
Bandla described the moment as emotional and said, ""I have been dreaming of going to space since I was young and literally it is a dream come true.""
 
""I have wanted to be an astronaut but I wasn't able to go in the traditional National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) role and I took a very unconventional way to go to space and I do believe that a lot of people are going to be able to experience this and that's why we are here,"" she added.

On being asked if this was just a joyride for rich people, she said, ""As Virgin Galactic builds up...this is VSS Unity's ride to space today but we have got two more spaceships in the manufacture and we hope the cost would come down.""
Virgin Galactic  — the business Branson started in 2004  — aims to fly private citizens to the edge of space. The trips are designed to permit passengers to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and observe the curvature of Earth.
The Virgin Galactic carrier can launch up to eight people (two pilots and six passengers) on the Unity 22 flight, but on Sunday there were only six occupants (two pilots and four passengers).
 
The four mission specialists evaluated different experiences that Virgin Galactic has promised its future customers, many of whom have already reserved trips to space with the company at USD 250,000 a seat.

"Hyderabad: Veteran Bollywood actor Dilip Kumar who breathed his last on Wednesday at the age of 98 had his share of bittersweet memories of Hyderabad. He married a Hyderabadi woman Asma Rahman sometime in 1980, though he was already married to Saira Banu. Dilip Kumar said a conspiracy was hatched that forced him to marry Asma Rahman.
Saira Banu was reportedly not aware of Dilip Kumar’s marriage with Asma. She came to know about it in 1982 when a tabloid made this sensational revelation. Though Saira Banu was pained to hear the news, she stood by Dilip Kumar when he had admitted his mistake and sought her time to undo the wrong through proper legal process and restore the sanctity of their marriage. Later Dilip Kumar divorced Asma.
 
Dilip Kumar had inaugurated the Owaisi Hospital & Research Centre managed by All India Majlis Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen in 1996. At a young age, Dilip Kumar used to visit Hyderabad. He had attended a few functions and wedding ceremonies held in Hyderabad. Dilip Kumar also contributed to the development of the Deccan Medical College.

"Hyderabad: The city’s air is rife with Nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This is contrary to popular belief that the lockdown has helped improve the air quality, an analysis conducted by Greenpeace India Society has found.
Nitrogen dioxide pollution is known to cause damage to the human respiratory tract, cause asthma and make a person vulnerable to other respiratory infections. The study said there was growing evidence that polluted cities suffered disproportionately more from coronavirus cases.
 
Increased concentrations of NO2, Greenpeace said, were found not just in Hyderabad but across several cities in India during the current Covid19 pandemic.
The report published on Wednesday said: “In Hyderabad, nitrogen dioxide air pollution was 69 per cent higher in April 2021 than in the same month the previous year. A part of this difference is attributable to changing weather conditions. After removing the effect of weather, there is still an increase of 38 per cent which is attributed to an increase in emissions.”
After a year since the initial Covid lockdown went into effect, NO2 pollution has increased in eight Indian cities -- Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Lucknow.
 
According to satellite observations, NO2 pollution in Hyderabad increased by 69 per cent between April 2020 and April 2021. The weather had only a little of the contribution to this change. In Delhi, NO2 was higher by 125 per cent, Chennai by 94 per cent Mumbai by 52 per cent, Bengaluru by 90 per cent Kolkata by 11 per cent, Jaipur by 47 per cent and Lucknow by 32 per cent in April 2021 than in the same month the previous year
While there was an opinion that the weather conditions would abate the pollution, the result drawn out in the study showed that despite taking the weather conditions into account,  NO2 pollution occurred. This was primarily due to changes in emissions, while weather influence was only of secondary importance in most places,” it said.
 
According to Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner with Greenpeace India, “The air quality levels in these cities are alarming. People saw clean skies and breathed fresh air during the nationwide lockdown though it was an unintended consequence of the pandemic. The disruption caused by the pandemic is a case for transition to cleaner, equitable and sustainable decentralised energy sources such as rooftop solar and clean and sustainable mobility. The recovery from the pandemic must not come at the expense of a return to previous levels of air pollution.”

"Thiruvananthapuram: Tourists coming to Kerala will now be able to savour delicious local cuisine while sitting in the comfort of their cars as the state Tourism Department launched in-car dining to boost tourism and also to meet the challenges of COVID-19.
The restaurants run by Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) across the state will cater to tourists with in-car dining.
 
To know how it feels like dining in a car, Kerala Tourism Minister PA Mohammed Riyas himself had his favourite dishes sitting inside his car.
""The in-car dining is a project designed to give a boost to Kerala tourism sector hit badly by COVID-19. To revive we are launching this project by which tourists coming to Kerala will be able to use this service. Amid COVID-19 pandemic, instead of dining inside a restaurant and mingling with the crowd, such a project will also ensure safety,"" said Riyas.
Kayamkulam MLA U Pratibha also joined the minister during the launch of the project.
 
This venture comes at a time when tourism, which is a mainstay of Kerala that contributes to 11 per cent to state SDP, incurred loss due to COVID-19.
To overcome the crisis, the Kerala government also has mooted the idea of complete vaccinated tourism and also to find new tourism destinations.
The Tourism Minister said the state has initiated a project in which a new destination will be identified in every Panchayat. There are also projects in the pipeline to develop new heritage and pilgrim tourism destinations to attract maximum domestic travellers.

"New Delhi: “Matrimonial ad by a feminist” is an oxymoron. These advertisements are often sexist and casteist, putting emphasis on attributes like caste, class, height, and the colour of one’s skin, and using salary and other wealth related attributes to appeal to potential matrimonial partners.
However, a matrimonial advertisement “by a feminist” went viral after comedian Aditi Mittal tweeted about it, bringing the advertisement into the limelight.
 
The advertisement read: “Match for opinionated feminist. 30+ educated girl, short hair, piercings, works in the social sector against capitalism. Wanted handsome, well-built, strictly 25-28 years old only son with established business, bungalow/at least 20 acre farmhouse. Should know cooking. No farters/burpers please. Write to curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com.”
The advertisement, obviously fake, was a prank to emphasise the sexist and misogynistic ideology behind matrimonial advertisements. The owners of the email curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com- under the pseudonyms Sakshi, her brother Srijan and her best friend Damyanti- told BBC that it was a prank played on Sakshi for her 30th birthday.
 
""Turning 30 is a milestone, especially because of all the conversation in our society around marriage. As you turn 30, your family and society start putting pressure on you to get married and settle down,"" Srijan said.
However, once the advertisement went viral, it reopened the debate of the sexism and misogyny of matrimonial ads. Though she did receive many positive emails, Sakshi claimed that there were a plethora of hate emails sent her way as the ad hurt a lot of fragile egos, ranging from feminism-bashers to trolls sending death threats over a prank.
 
""You can't say such things out loud. Men ask for tall, slim beautiful brides all the time, they brag about their wealth, but when the tables are turned, they can't stomach it. How could a woman set such criteria?"" She added, ""[The ad] was a satirical statement on this narrative and I assume that the people getting triggered are the same as those who put out these kinds of 'slim, fair, beautiful bride wanted' type of ads in the first place"".
And for those upset by an obvious prank, she asks: ""Do you send such triggered emails to all the sexist, casteist 'bride wanted' adverts that appear in the papers everyday? If not, then you need to curb your patriarchy"".

"Hyderabad: It was a chance discovery, says Dr Kumar Eswaran, a mathematical physicist in the city, who claims to have found the solution to the Riemann Hypothesis, a millennium problem in mathematics. It was waiting for proof for 161 years, Dr Eswaran told this newspaper.
The Riemann Hypothesis, touted to be number one out of the top 10 unsolved mathematical problems, was designated as a millennium problem in 2000, with a reward of $1 million from Clay Mathematics Institute, Oxford, England, for anyone who could solve it.
 
""It was, in fact, back in 2016, that I first gave proof for the formula improved by the great mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann in the 1800s. I had put it on the web for open review and downloads after working on it for about six weeks. During 2018-19, I gave several lectures on the proof,” Dr Eswaran, 74, who is with the Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Hyderabad, said.
The Riemann Hypothesis, in the simplest possible explanation, relates to how prime numbers are distributed. This has been a problem that has challenged mathematicians for generations. According to mathematicians who have grappled with the hypothesis, proof of the Riemann Hypothesis would have far-reaching consequences for number theory and for the use of primes in cryptography, and would automatically lead to the proof of numerous theorems which are dependent on the truth of this hypothesis.
 
In Dr Eswaran's methodology, the ‘factorisation sequence of numbers’ was shown to be like a 'random walk', he said. ""This method used was actually not just number theories. I had to use techniques from random variables and probability as well,"" Dr Eswaran added.  
An expert committee of scientists including Dr T. Ramasami, former secretary, Union ministry of science and technology, Prof. P. Narasimha Reddy, executive director, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Prof. M. Seetharaman, former professor and Chair, department of theoretical physics, University of Madras, Prof. V. Srinivasan, former professor and dean, School of Physics, UoH, Prof. K. Srinivasa Rao, former senior professor, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, Prof. M. D. Srinivas, senior Fellow, Centre for Policy Studies, Prof. Vinayak Eswaran, department of mechanical and aerospace engineering, IIT Hyderabad, and Dr Adindla Suma, associate professor, department of computer science, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology conducted an open review of the proof for a year from February 2020 to conclude that Dr Eswaran had indeed proved the Riemann Hypothesis.  
 
The committee invited more than 1,200 mathematicians to participate in an open review of the presented proof. The review was open in the sense that the referees had to be willing to have their names and institutional affiliations openly revealed, so that nothing is done anonymously, and nothing can be said that would not be openly available for all other experts to see.
Dr Eswaran said in his experience this had been the most fair and robust way to get the proposed proof assessed. The expert committee then examined the comments of the reviewers and the responses of the author. In their final meeting held on May 16, the committee concluded that Dr Eswaran’s proof of the Riemann Hypothesis is correct.
 
The committee also ruled that the proof, the referees’ comments, and the author’s responses in their entirety, without any redactions, should be published in the form of an e-book and made available to the public at large and then followed, a few months later, by a hard copy.

"ANANTAPUR: Lack of rains yet in parts of Rayalaseema has led to rural people enacting the centuries-old tradition of protesting against the Rain God with “Karuvu Rallu” or drought stones.
As per the tradition, villagers in this drought-prone region throw waste material of their village, including the drought stones, on outskirts of another village to appease the Rain God into showering rains. Villagers, however, exercise caution while throwing the drought stones, lest it lead to a clash with members of the targeted village.
 
All such stones are finally dumped into Penna and other rivers of Rayalaseema bordering Karnataka. Senior citizens say this tradition has been continuing even to this day, as the practise not only appeases the Rain God but also checks farmers from falling into depression due to their inability in raising crops.
This Deccan Chronicle reporter saw a dump of drought stones on outskirts of Seebai village in Kalyanadurgam mandal of Anantapur district. They must have been dumped there by inmates of one of the villages trying to appease the Rain God.
 
Rajanna from Kalayandurgam area said this tradition has been a part of Rayalaseema farmers’ life for many centuries. Karuvu Rallu on outskirts of another village are seen as a positive sign.
Dr. Harinath Reddy of Rayalaseema Vedika says this tradition of protest is mostly seen in villages around Goddess Gangamma temples, which are constructed mostly close to river beds and irrigation tanks. “At these temples, villagers seeking rains offer traditional poojas and ululate to express their grief at lack of rains”, Dr Reddy explained.
 
According to reports available, many areas of Rayalaseema have experienced 72 drought years in the past 145 years. Such high variability in southwest monsoon is an indicator of the risk associated with farming in this district. It has 7 lakh hectares of dry land whose cultivators depend only on seasonal rains.

The ’Flying Sikh’ died of Covid complications late on Saturday night. He was 91.
 
He trained in and around the EME Centre area, building his strength and stamina by taking up many an uphill task — he would run up the Ammuguda hill carrying a stone-filled bag and also run alongside a train, which ran on the then metre gauge track between Bolaram and Ammuguda. “The driver of a particular train used to encourage and egg me on. It was kind of a motivation and I could run for a longer distance,” Milkha recalled in interviews later.
He has always credited the Army, EME and Secunderabad Cantonment for his sporting success. “Had I not joined the Army I would not have worked so hard,” Milkha said.
 
Fittingly, a colony in the EME Centre is named after him, as also the Stadium inside the EME Centre where he trained. While inaugurating the Milkha Singh Stadium in 2014, the legend had got emotional, kissed the turf and said it was like a gurudwara to him.
Secunderabad, where Milkha lived from 1952 to 1960 and prepared for the 1960 Olympics at which he missed the 400 metres bronze medal by a whisker, was always special to him. “Whenever he came across athletes from Secunderabad/ Hyderabad, he would develop an instant affinity. ‘Mai Secunderabad ka rice khaney ke baad running start kiya’ (I have started running after eating rice in Secunderabad) he once told me in jest. He would also talk about his many memories here,” Prabhakara Rao Mulagala, veteran long-distance runner from the city, told this newspaper.
 
“We should also remember Milkha used to run on cinder tracks, not on the present synthetic ones that give athletes the advantage of up to a second. He was the first to run the 400m under 46 seconds, at a meet in Oslo (Norway) a fortnight or so before the Rome Olympics, where he was unfortunate to finish fourth, 0.1 second behind Malcolm Spence of South Africa. Later, South Africa was banned from sport for 36 years because of apartheid... that bronze could’ve belonged to Milkha, who competed against the world’s best,” added Prabhakara, who has won 300-plus gold medals at national and international races, and at 69 still competes in races.

"Thiruvananthapuram: Tourists coming to Kerala will now be able to savour delicious local cuisine while sitting in the comfort of their cars as the state Tourism Department launched in-car dining to boost tourism and also to meet the challenges of COVID-19.
The restaurants run by Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) across the state will cater to tourists with in-car dining.
 
To know how it feels like dining in a car, Kerala Tourism Minister PA Mohammed Riyas himself had his favourite dishes sitting inside his car.
""The in-car dining is a project designed to give a boost to Kerala tourism sector hit badly by COVID-19. To revive we are launching this project by which tourists coming to Kerala will be able to use this service. Amid COVID-19 pandemic, instead of dining inside a restaurant and mingling with the crowd, such a project will also ensure safety,"" said Riyas.
Kayamkulam MLA U Pratibha also joined the minister during the launch of the project.
 
This venture comes at a time when tourism, which is a mainstay of Kerala that contributes to 11 per cent to state SDP, incurred loss due to COVID-19.
To overcome the crisis, the Kerala government also has mooted the idea of complete vaccinated tourism and also to find new tourism destinations.
The Tourism Minister said the state has initiated a project in which a new destination will be identified in every Panchayat. There are also projects in the pipeline to develop new heritage and pilgrim tourism destinations to attract maximum domestic travellers.

"Hyderabad: If a scriptwriter had proposed a few years ago a logline for a movie which read – an actor from Punjabi, with a six-pack body, who has played a villain on screen for over two decades, finds a calling in the midst of a pandemic.
His real-life works make him the most beloved superstar across the country, the trust in him built rapidly as he works to connect, first with migrant workers and trying to help them, and as a second wave hits, responding to people from across the country, reaching out to him with a trust they repose in him greater than in governments. And in cineaste Telugu states, gods of decades slide down the charts, downed by a virus, leaving only one real star.
 
Such a script would never have found a director accepting it. Even the audiences would have found it beyond plausibility, even for a story. But when life scripts stories and reality screens it, not for two hours but years, anything is possible. Such has been the script starring Sonu Sood since Coronavirus spread its menacing tentacles and brought down every order of society and all semblances of sanity.
But in dark times, heroes arise from unexpected spots. Lending help, giving hope, sharing light, redefining love, and metamorphosing fan following.
 
Speaking to Deccan Chronicle about his inner motivations to emerge from the fringes of celebritydom to becoming a trusted icon of a ravage nation’s people, Sonu Sood, in a soft soothing voice of a healer rather than a preferred negative actor of the movie screen, said, “growing up in Moga, Punjab, I saw my mother, a teacher, give free tuition classes for decades. Outside my father’s shop, there would always be a langar, where I too would serve food. It was a lesson ingrained for life that you must always be there to serve in whatever capacity you have.”
 
When asked about the incident that prompted him to emerge out of lockdown and pandemic fears to become a frontline hero, Mr Sood said, “last year, when I started hearing stories of migrant workers, I knew I could no longer sit in the security and comfort of my home. As a migrant worker myself, though privileged and lucky, I could empathise with their angst. It started with serving food and giving basic financial help to organising to help them in larger numbers.”
The legend grew quickly because of the vacuum. None of India’s conventional heroes – film stars, cricketers, billionaires – were there to really make a significant difference. Sood’s rise in being recognised as a saviour is also a deep reflection of the indifference of the others.
 
How do you feel about being recognised and trusted so much by people that they tag you on twitter for help before government agencies or ministers? Do you feel pressure to deliver?
He smiles, and in one of the most humane voices I have heard in a long time, replies, “there is no pressure when a friend or family member expects you to stand for them. It is no different. Every bit of time, money and effort I can muster, I am out there because I know somewhere, someone who has reached out to me is waiting and expecting. It is a call I must respond to, and I can’t let them down.”
 
I scratch my head, a bit bewildered. Is it a mere PR exercise? Or did I get connected to Dalia Lama by mistake? It is, I do not think it is his fault that others in the cine world have used charity as a ticket to sell more tickets for their next release. Last year, we were stuck with the tragic story of another SS in Bollywood – Sushant Singh. This SS has risen now to become India’s superhero, without a cape, just a twitter handle.
Are you a bit embarrassed Sonu, I ask him, that others in your film fraternity, Bollywood or Tollywood, who have received greater stardom and earned far more money and influence, never cared to take up work like yours in one of our worst years ever? He answers candidly, but with sangfroid. “You can’t force a feeling of wanting to help people. It can’t even be taught beyond a point. It must come from within.”
 
What next? Will this image harm your film career? Next time any film fans see him on screen as a villain, will the portrayal be convincing? “I am not thinking of the next film. Just my next SOS call.”
He disappears to do good for someone, somewhere. A villain has refined heroism, forever. My vote for the biggest star in films in India in a dark year – Sonu Sood.

"New Delhi: “Matrimonial ad by a feminist” is an oxymoron. These advertisements are often sexist and casteist, putting emphasis on attributes like caste, class, height, and the colour of one’s skin, and using salary and other wealth related attributes to appeal to potential matrimonial partners.
However, a matrimonial advertisement “by a feminist” went viral after comedian Aditi Mittal tweeted about it, bringing the advertisement into the limelight.
 
The advertisement read: “Match for opinionated feminist. 30+ educated girl, short hair, piercings, works in the social sector against capitalism. Wanted handsome, well-built, strictly 25-28 years old only son with established business, bungalow/at least 20 acre farmhouse. Should know cooking. No farters/burpers please. Write to curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com.”
The advertisement, obviously fake, was a prank to emphasise the sexist and misogynistic ideology behind matrimonial advertisements. The owners of the email curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com- under the pseudonyms Sakshi, her brother Srijan and her best friend Damyanti- told BBC that it was a prank played on Sakshi for her 30th birthday.
 
""Turning 30 is a milestone, especially because of all the conversation in our society around marriage. As you turn 30, your family and society start putting pressure on you to get married and settle down,"" Srijan said.
However, once the advertisement went viral, it reopened the debate of the sexism and misogyny of matrimonial ads. Though she did receive many positive emails, Sakshi claimed that there were a plethora of hate emails sent her way as the ad hurt a lot of fragile egos, ranging from feminism-bashers to trolls sending death threats over a prank.
 
""You can't say such things out loud. Men ask for tall, slim beautiful brides all the time, they brag about their wealth, but when the tables are turned, they can't stomach it. How could a woman set such criteria?"" She added, ""[The ad] was a satirical statement on this narrative and I assume that the people getting triggered are the same as those who put out these kinds of 'slim, fair, beautiful bride wanted' type of ads in the first place"".
And for those upset by an obvious prank, she asks: ""Do you send such triggered emails to all the sexist, casteist 'bride wanted' adverts that appear in the papers everyday? If not, then you need to curb your patriarchy"".

"Nellore: The Ayush department team studying the concoction prepared by Bonigi Anandaiah at Krishnapatnam and hawked as a cure for Covid-19 cannot be termed an Ayurvedic medicine.
They said that Ayush protocols and guidelines do not accept these preparations as Ayurvedic drugs. They felt that the preparations were similar to traditional local medicines, hinting that there is no need for any licence.
 
Speaking to this newspaper, Commissioner of Ayush and head of the team, Col. V. Ramulu, said that there are no harmful ingredients in the substance being given by Anandaiah, including the eye drops.
“Anandaiah prepared all them before us and the process is very simple for anyone to produce. Moreover, he is willing to share the formula with the public,” he said.
The Ayush official said that Anandaiah has been using herbs including locally available leaves such as neem, mango and jamun apart from honey, pepper, green camphor, nutmeg, black cumin, turmeric and cinnamon among many other items, “which we use daily for preparing food items.”
 
In the eye drops, Anandaiah has been using pepper, mulla vankaya and honey, Col Ramulu noted. He said that the preparation cannot be prescribed for Covid-19 as the formula is one among hundreds of local remedies for different ailments. Citing an instance, he pointed to the popular Puttur treatment for broken bones.
Col Ramulu said they would submit a report to the government on their study. It is up to the government to take a decision, he added.

"Hyderabad: It was a chance discovery, says Dr Kumar Eswaran, a mathematical physicist in the city, who claims to have found the solution to the Riemann Hypothesis, a millennium problem in mathematics. It was waiting for proof for 161 years, Dr Eswaran told this newspaper.
The Riemann Hypothesis, touted to be number one out of the top 10 unsolved mathematical problems, was designated as a millennium problem in 2000, with a reward of $1 million from Clay Mathematics Institute, Oxford, England, for anyone who could solve it.
 
""It was, in fact, back in 2016, that I first gave proof for the formula improved by the great mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann in the 1800s. I had put it on the web for open review and downloads after working on it for about six weeks. During 2018-19, I gave several lectures on the proof,” Dr Eswaran, 74, who is with the Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Hyderabad, said.
The Riemann Hypothesis, in the simplest possible explanation, relates to how prime numbers are distributed. This has been a problem that has challenged mathematicians for generations. According to mathematicians who have grappled with the hypothesis, proof of the Riemann Hypothesis would have far-reaching consequences for number theory and for the use of primes in cryptography, and would automatically lead to the proof of numerous theorems which are dependent on the truth of this hypothesis.
 
In Dr Eswaran's methodology, the ‘factorisation sequence of numbers’ was shown to be like a 'random walk', he said. ""This method used was actually not just number theories. I had to use techniques from random variables and probability as well,"" Dr Eswaran added.  
An expert committee of scientists including Dr T. Ramasami, former secretary, Union ministry of science and technology, Prof. P. Narasimha Reddy, executive director, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Prof. M. Seetharaman, former professor and Chair, department of theoretical physics, University of Madras, Prof. V. Srinivasan, former professor and dean, School of Physics, UoH, Prof. K. Srinivasa Rao, former senior professor, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, Prof. M. D. Srinivas, senior Fellow, Centre for Policy Studies, Prof. Vinayak Eswaran, department of mechanical and aerospace engineering, IIT Hyderabad, and Dr Adindla Suma, associate professor, department of computer science, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology conducted an open review of the proof for a year from February 2020 to conclude that Dr Eswaran had indeed proved the Riemann Hypothesis.  
 
The committee invited more than 1,200 mathematicians to participate in an open review of the presented proof. The review was open in the sense that the referees had to be willing to have their names and institutional affiliations openly revealed, so that nothing is done anonymously, and nothing can be said that would not be openly available for all other experts to see.
Dr Eswaran said in his experience this had been the most fair and robust way to get the proposed proof assessed. The expert committee then examined the comments of the reviewers and the responses of the author. In their final meeting held on May 16, the committee concluded that Dr Eswaran’s proof of the Riemann Hypothesis is correct.
 
The committee also ruled that the proof, the referees’ comments, and the author’s responses in their entirety, without any redactions, should be published in the form of an e-book and made available to the public at large and then followed, a few months later, by a hard copy.

"Hyderabad: On turning 43 in May two year ago, Pushpak, a highly successful senior executive with a global fin-tech firm located in the Financial District, made several changes in his lifestyle. These included getting a farm house in the town, buying a new SUV and promising to block his calendar for a family holiday abroad.
His fitness goals included joining a gym, cycling and running. His life revolved around the stress of managing his own wealth portfolio as also his financial goals and ambitions.
 
Two years later, the SUV means far less to him. His farmhouse seems a trifle less important.
He has lost two members in his extended family, a close friend and several friends. He has failed at least in one case; despite all the money, he failed to get an ICU bed for a close relative in another city.
He now has a new priority; having peace of mind. After many trials, he has chosen an unlikely route – meditation – to achieve his goal.
Speaking on the eve of World Meditation Day, Pushpak says, “I knew it but missed the significance of such an elementary truth in life. Life is all about breathing. We breathe, we are alive. For all my life, I took it for granted. Today, anxiety and stress, fear and worry are all taking a toll on my life. Corona has raised questions on what we thought was our success. The calm of being aware of my own breath has been the greatest learning.”
 
He’s alone now. Hordes of people have been forced by the pandemic and its continuing challenges to seek and find mental peace through meditation.
Kamala Chirravuri, one of the top-notch yoga meditation teachers in Hyderabad, has celebrities -- those with serious mental issues and corporate executives -- seeking her help. She offers them counseling and personalized yoga-meditation solutions.
“Meditation as defined by Patanjali comprises dharana and dhyana. Dharana is singularly focusing all our conscious attention on one object, the starting point of meditation. Dhyana is the highest level we can achieve, wherein we are immersed and become one with the flow,” she says.
 
When asked about her heightened interest in meditation, Kamala replies, “It feels like we are in the midst of a mythological pralaya. To face the unrest outside, we must find strength, peace and calm within. Once we learn to focus our attention within, and become aware of our breath, we find a center and we reduce the imbalance that causes stress, anxiety and unrest.”
A trainer in the Krishnamacharya tradition, Kamala is comfortable with the diversity of meditation techniques. “There are many techniques from Vipassana, the focus on breath and sensations, to chanting of ‘Om’ to visualizations. Anything that works for you! But the one constant in life is our breathing.”
 
Sanjay Sehgal, a director at Heartfulness, says, “In our technique, we begin with thought as a focal point and dive deeper into the heart. This is a 76-years-old technique of diving deeper and achieving a higher level of consciousness.”
He says, “People may reach out for various reasons. Relieving your stress or finding peace is easy. I often say, you can find peace with a peg of good whiskey or if you can avoid fighting with your spouse. But finding sustainable inner peace, to be a better person, is harder, which is where we take you to.”
 
The heart-centred meditation, which has millions of practitioners, over 14,000 trainers and over 260 ashrams in 130 nations, renders its service all free.
When quizzed about the recent spurt in interest, Sehgal says, “Even a basic practice of pranayamam will help you at a physical level. It expands your lungs and eases the flow of air from your nose to inside. It can most certainly help during Covid times. Bad things can happen to anyone. But a great gift of meditation is that it helps you alter and find a better sense of control over your own reactions and responses. I have seen in my own family that those who meditate had a distinctly different and qualitatively better response to the emergencies arising out of the Covid pandemic than to those who don’t meditate.”
 
Trainers have adopted technology in the Covid season to ensure that meditation can be taught in the virtual mode. From an institutional meditation like Heartfulness, whose global headquarters is in Hyderabad and whose spiritual leader Daaji has held remote virtual sessions to individual trainers like Kamala, to those who are doing sessions through Zoom or Google Meets, technology is helping bring together the agitated with those who guide you to inner peace.

"ANANTAPUR: Lack of rains yet in parts of Rayalaseema has led to rural people enacting the centuries-old tradition of protesting against the Rain God with “Karuvu Rallu” or drought stones.
As per the tradition, villagers in this drought-prone region throw waste material of their village, including the drought stones, on outskirts of another village to appease the Rain God into showering rains. Villagers, however, exercise caution while throwing the drought stones, lest it lead to a clash with members of the targeted village.
 
All such stones are finally dumped into Penna and other rivers of Rayalaseema bordering Karnataka. Senior citizens say this tradition has been continuing even to this day, as the practise not only appeases the Rain God but also checks farmers from falling into depression due to their inability in raising crops.
This Deccan Chronicle reporter saw a dump of drought stones on outskirts of Seebai village in Kalyanadurgam mandal of Anantapur district. They must have been dumped there by inmates of one of the villages trying to appease the Rain God.
 
Rajanna from Kalayandurgam area said this tradition has been a part of Rayalaseema farmers’ life for many centuries. Karuvu Rallu on outskirts of another village are seen as a positive sign.
Dr. Harinath Reddy of Rayalaseema Vedika says this tradition of protest is mostly seen in villages around Goddess Gangamma temples, which are constructed mostly close to river beds and irrigation tanks. “At these temples, villagers seeking rains offer traditional poojas and ululate to express their grief at lack of rains”, Dr Reddy explained.
 
According to reports available, many areas of Rayalaseema have experienced 72 drought years in the past 145 years. Such high variability in southwest monsoon is an indicator of the risk associated with farming in this district. It has 7 lakh hectares of dry land whose cultivators depend only on seasonal rains.

"Hyderabad: A few organisations are striving hard to make sure that frontline warriors against Covid-19 pandemic and other caregivers are not deprived of food, groceries and other bare necessities during their fight against the pandemic.
One such organisation, Give Hope Foundation, in association with a privately operated restaurant, started a campaign to help frontline Covid workers each day. As a part of its drive, the members of the organisation are providing protective gear, masks and nutritious healthy meals to them. Anybody can participate and donate groceries and other food items by scanning the Give Hope Foundation QR code.
 
Speaking to this newspaper, Vasumana Ghosh, a representative of the organisation said, “We have been active for some time, but in the last two weeks we have had some tremendous response for the drive.”
“We have conducted various activities like supplying food and groceries to at old-age homes, orphanages, GHMC workers and schools during these Covid times,” she said.  
During the pandemic, the group has distributed Rs 1.5 lakh worth masks and sanitisers to law and order departments, traffic police, GHMC workers and sanitation workers, she added.

"Hyderabad: Milkha Singh made waves at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, but his baby steps as a sprinter were taken here in Secunderabad, where he was recruited in the Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (EME) of the Army back in 1952.
The ’Flying Sikh’ died of Covid complications late on Saturday night. He was 91.
 
He trained in and around the EME Centre area, building his strength and stamina by taking up many an uphill task — he would run up the Ammuguda hill carrying a stone-filled bag and also run alongside a train, which ran on the then metre gauge track between Bolaram and Ammuguda. “The driver of a particular train used to encourage and egg me on. It was kind of a motivation and I could run for a longer distance,” Milkha recalled in interviews later.
He has always credited the Army, EME and Secunderabad Cantonment for his sporting success. “Had I not joined the Army I would not have worked so hard,” Milkha said.
 
Fittingly, a colony in the EME Centre is named after him, as also the Stadium inside the EME Centre where he trained. While inaugurating the Milkha Singh Stadium in 2014, the legend had got emotional, kissed the turf and said it was like a gurudwara to him.
Secunderabad, where Milkha lived from 1952 to 1960 and prepared for the 1960 Olympics at which he missed the 400 metres bronze medal by a whisker, was always special to him. “Whenever he came across athletes from Secunderabad/ Hyderabad, he would develop an instant affinity. ‘Mai Secunderabad ka rice khaney ke baad running start kiya’ (I have started running after eating rice in Secunderabad) he once told me in jest. He would also talk about his many memories here,” Prabhakara Rao Mulagala, veteran long-distance runner from the city, told this newspaper.
 
“We should also remember Milkha used to run on cinder tracks, not on the present synthetic ones that give athletes the advantage of up to a second. He was the first to run the 400m under 46 seconds, at a meet in Oslo (Norway) a fortnight or so before the Rome Olympics, where he was unfortunate to finish fourth, 0.1 second behind Malcolm Spence of South Africa. Later, South Africa was banned from sport for 36 years because of apartheid... that bronze could’ve belonged to Milkha, who competed against the world’s best,” added Prabhakara, who has won 300-plus gold medals at national and international races, and at 69 still competes in races.

"HYDERABAD: The air inside is cool, but thick with Coronavirus. Among the 13 patients in a Covid-19 ICU, some are on ventilators as their bodies wracked by the virus try and fight back the disease.
The sight is pathetic. The tube inside the throat adds to their cough. Each time a patient coughs, countless virus particles are spewed into the air.
 
Inside the blue full body protection kits, doctors, nurses and other support staff go about their tasks methodically. At stake are the lives of infected patients who, along with their families, have placed their faith in god the almighty and the hospital staff.
The staff in attendance is practising a new regimen of long shifts on slim meals and controlled fluid intake. “If anyone wants to take a break, they will take off the PPE kits and spend 20 minutes in the restroom and spend another 20 minutes putting on a fresh kit. In the meanwhile, we need to find a replacement for that person for a similar duration,” explained Dr K. Subba Reddy, chief intensivist at Apollo Hospital.
 
Last year, when patients began streaming into the ICU at Apollo in Jubilee Hills, there was fear and apprehension among the staff. Everyone was worried and scared. It was Annapurna, a senior housekeeping staffer, who gave the medics the confidence to carry on.
“I had attended to the requirements of TB, AIDS and Chicken Pox patients. We overcame those situations with courage and we can overcome this too,” she had told them. “That gave us a lot of motivation and strength. Then there was one of our nurses Pyun Su Klin, who lost her sister and brother in the first wave. Yet, she said she will not take a break or go home, but continued to work, saying there were so many pat-ients around to be taken care of,” Dr Subba Reddy recalled. While the stress of working to save lives every minute is itself a challenging experience, so is it that an ICU staffer cannot mingle with own family as a matter of precaution.
 
The air in a Covid-19 ICU is thick with the virus. Intubated patients are coughing, generating aerosols carrying the virus particles.
Subba Reddy, over the past one year, has only been seeing his 11-year-old daughter from a distance, in a different apartment where she lives with her grandparents. Going nearer meant a risk to the child.
Coming off a prolonged 72-hour shift, Dr K. Swarna Deepak, also of Apollo, told Deccan Chronicle on Sunday: “Sometimes you just cannot take a break. Over the last couple of days, we opened more ICUs for Covid patients.”
 
And if a hospital runs out of ventilators, the doctors and nurses would resort to sheer physical stamina, drawing every ounce of strength they have to keep a patient alive.
Using a bag ventilator, they keep pumping, squeezing the bag to push oxygen into a patient’s lungs. “And when one arm gets tired, you just switch arms and continue. As long as it takes,” Dr Deepak said.
Elsewhere, at KIMS hospital, Dr Sambit Sahu, a critical and intensive care specialist, talks wistfully of what the scene was just a few weeks ago. “We barely had three patients in the Covid19 ICU. Then it hit us like a storm. All of a sudden, it was 50 patients; and by the time we realised what was happening, we had a 100 of them in these ICUs,” he said.
 
Unlike last year, Covid19 was a novel disease and what everyone heard about it came from other parts of the world. The second wave is different. There was a sense of mental fatigue, of coming out of a stressful year. “We just got out of a traumatic year. And the feeling as the patients began pouring in was Oh God! Not Again!,” Dr Sahu said.
As the virus keeps flying around in the ICUs, the doctors have just one prayer on their lips; that they be able to save the life of every patient and that people at large followed the safety measures and helped medical professionals by keeping the case loads low.
 
“If that does not happen soon, we are in for a disaster,” said Dr Subba Reddy.

"Hyderabad: If a scriptwriter had proposed a few years ago a logline for a movie which read – an actor from Punjabi, with a six-pack body, who has played a villain on screen for over two decades, finds a calling in the midst of a pandemic.
His real-life works make him the most beloved superstar across the country, the trust in him built rapidly as he works to connect, first with migrant workers and trying to help them, and as a second wave hits, responding to people from across the country, reaching out to him with a trust they repose in him greater than in governments. And in cineaste Telugu states, gods of decades slide down the charts, downed by a virus, leaving only one real star.
 
Such a script would never have found a director accepting it. Even the audiences would have found it beyond plausibility, even for a story. But when life scripts stories and reality screens it, not for two hours but years, anything is possible. Such has been the script starring Sonu Sood since Coronavirus spread its menacing tentacles and brought down every order of society and all semblances of sanity.
But in dark times, heroes arise from unexpected spots. Lending help, giving hope, sharing light, redefining love, and metamorphosing fan following.
 
Speaking to Deccan Chronicle about his inner motivations to emerge from the fringes of celebritydom to becoming a trusted icon of a ravage nation’s people, Sonu Sood, in a soft soothing voice of a healer rather than a preferred negative actor of the movie screen, said, “growing up in Moga, Punjab, I saw my mother, a teacher, give free tuition classes for decades. Outside my father’s shop, there would always be a langar, where I too would serve food. It was a lesson ingrained for life that you must always be there to serve in whatever capacity you have.”
 
When asked about the incident that prompted him to emerge out of lockdown and pandemic fears to become a frontline hero, Mr Sood said, “last year, when I started hearing stories of migrant workers, I knew I could no longer sit in the security and comfort of my home. As a migrant worker myself, though privileged and lucky, I could empathise with their angst. It started with serving food and giving basic financial help to organising to help them in larger numbers.”
The legend grew quickly because of the vacuum. None of India’s conventional heroes – film stars, cricketers, billionaires – were there to really make a significant difference. Sood’s rise in being recognised as a saviour is also a deep reflection of the indifference of the others.
 
How do you feel about being recognised and trusted so much by people that they tag you on twitter for help before government agencies or ministers? Do you feel pressure to deliver?
He smiles, and in one of the most humane voices I have heard in a long time, replies, “there is no pressure when a friend or family member expects you to stand for them. It is no different. Every bit of time, money and effort I can muster, I am out there because I know somewhere, someone who has reached out to me is waiting and expecting. It is a call I must respond to, and I can’t let them down.”
 
I scratch my head, a bit bewildered. Is it a mere PR exercise? Or did I get connected to Dalia Lama by mistake? It is, I do not think it is his fault that others in the cine world have used charity as a ticket to sell more tickets for their next release. Last year, we were stuck with the tragic story of another SS in Bollywood – Sushant Singh. This SS has risen now to become India’s superhero, without a cape, just a twitter handle.
Are you a bit embarrassed Sonu, I ask him, that others in your film fraternity, Bollywood or Tollywood, who have received greater stardom and earned far more money and influence, never cared to take up work like yours in one of our worst years ever? He answers candidly, but with sangfroid. “You can’t force a feeling of wanting to help people. It can’t even be taught beyond a point. It must come from within.”
 
What next? Will this image harm your film career? Next time any film fans see him on screen as a villain, will the portrayal be convincing? “I am not thinking of the next film. Just my next SOS call.”
He disappears to do good for someone, somewhere. A villain has refined heroism, forever. My vote for the biggest star in films in India in a dark year – Sonu Sood.

"HYDERABAD: Doctors and nurses attending to Covid-19 patients and posting their videos on social media sum up the trauma they experience in Covid wards, where the pandemic is staging a dance of death and devastation. End of the day, they often break down into tears.
Medical professionals handling the dying patients say counseling their families on the wait outside is itself a huge task and painful experience. Cases are one too many, hospitals are running out of beds, there is shortage of support systems and life-saving equipment, and the virus’s variants are often difficult to identify.
 
The medical staff is face-to-face with death and strained also by the extra hours of work day after day, in iterations. Worse, they are exposed closer to this deadly virus than the general public.
Many doctors, nurses and other medical staff have lost their lives while treating the patients. Here is a war-like situation. They are also scared about the possibility that they carry the killer virus home and spread it to the family.
Alongside comes the people’s irresponsible behavior, couldn’t-care-less attitude, the mass gatherings, political rallies, cinema craze, all helping spread the deadly virus. All these are happening when the frontline Covid warriors are staking their lives and attending to patients non-stop and gasping for breath.
 
Dr Anita Rego, mental health professional and psychotherapist, said: “As frontline workers they deal with the real miseries of the patients, those who are struggling on their beds, those who are breathing their last. The stories of medical success are often clouded by these realities. We need to build an envelope of caring professionals and psychotherapists on whom they can fall back and build their strength and energy.”
She added: “Providing healthcare workers with stronger networks of specialist mental health services is not yet a priority with our health system and we need to advocate it.”
 
Dr Daljeet Kaur, consultant psychiatrist, said: “There will be frustration, stress and anxiety. The medical staff is disheartened because the situation is not in their control. When it comes to the doctors’ level, the coronavirus variants are unpredictable and it is difficult for them to understand the prognosis of patients.”
“The stress level, though, varies between individual and individual. While a senior doctor might be stressed and overwhelmed, a nursing staff or paramedic on the frontline and spending more time with the patient is more depressed seeing the conditions from close quarters.”
 
She suggested: “Counselors should be allocated for patients and the attenders. This will reduce the load of the consulting doctors. The medical staff should also be counseled on a periodical basis. Mental health of the medical staff should be a priority.”

Dr J Shivkumar, senior cardiologist: “The medical professionals are always under stress due to various reasons. Now, in the Covid situation, they are putting their lives on stake and saving the patient, whereas the general public is game with flaunting all the Covid protocols, further straining the health sector facilities.”
 
Dr Ashish Chauhan, Covid care expert at Apollo Hospital: “With an exposure some 100 to 1,000 times more that of the general public, the health care professionals are dead scared while performing their duties. Currently they are working like a soldier, ready to be martyred during a war. A sincere thanks by the patients and their relatives is what they expect.” 
“As per an IMA study, an average Indian doctor lives 10 years lesser than the normal population. Now, some 70 to 80 per cent of the patients are treated and they walkout healthy whereas some 20 to 30 per cent die. This is not an easy sight to digest.”
 
Dr  Karuna Madap, paediatrician, Covid-care: “Health care warriors should protect themselves and their families first. If they are physically and mentally strong, they can take care of hundreds patients. The medical staff should constantly take proper counseling for their mental health from a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist. There should be some organisation to come forward and provide nutritious food for the medical staff.”
Dr Sahithi Reddy Lebaka, junior doctor at Fever Hospital, Nallakunta: “Wearing plastic PPE kits for hours in his summer is not an easy task. Restless extra shifts due to constant patient flow, insufficient medical supplies and instruments, all these mean for us a mental fatigue.”
 
Dr M A Faroqui, professor, PG department of Unani medicine, Tibbi College, Charminar: “On Wednesday, two doctors in this Unani hospital have perished due to Covid-19. Over time, we will be drained out. There has to be equal participation of the public to overcome the present grim situation. When that fails to happen, we become mentally upset.”
Laxman Rudavath, Telangana nursing officers association general secretary: “Nurses are the first to serve patients. Even in these deadly situations, we take care of patients to the best. As we see around too many deaths and when a lot of patients sufferings, we naturally get depressed. We also have a fear that we are taking home the virus to our family.”
 
Jyothi, staff nurse, King Koti Hospital (Covid Centre): “We are exposed to so much of trauma during this pandemic. There is a sudden spike in the cases. When we return home we are out of our mood. Yes, there should be some mental health counselors for the medical workers.”
Sarala Kancharla, staff nursem Gandhi Hospital (State-assigned Covid-19 hospital): “The pouring in of patients, all around us, it’s suffering and suffering…  the shortage of staff, lack of support, our exposure to this deadly virus, the constant fear of us getting infected, we are stressed a lot these days.”
 
Ravindar Reddy, sanitization supervisor: “This wave made many of us think: is this worth taking risk? We are also seeing discrimination near our place, we are very depressed these days, and yet work should go on.”
Haseena Begum, Ayah, Nelofer Hospital: “Seeing the sufferings of patients, especially little children who are infected by coronavirus, makes us more sad and these days we don’t even feel like eating. We all are so scared!”

"Nellore: The Ayush department team studying the concoction prepared by Bonigi Anandaiah at Krishnapatnam and hawked as a cure for Covid-19 cannot be termed an Ayurvedic medicine.
They said that Ayush protocols and guidelines do not accept these preparations as Ayurvedic drugs. They felt that the preparations were similar to traditional local medicines, hinting that there is no need for any licence.
 
Speaking to this newspaper, Commissioner of Ayush and head of the team, Col. V. Ramulu, said that there are no harmful ingredients in the substance being given by Anandaiah, including the eye drops.
“Anandaiah prepared all them before us and the process is very simple for anyone to produce. Moreover, he is willing to share the formula with the public,” he said.
The Ayush official said that Anandaiah has been using herbs including locally available leaves such as neem, mango and jamun apart from honey, pepper, green camphor, nutmeg, black cumin, turmeric and cinnamon among many other items, “which we use daily for preparing food items.”
 
In the eye drops, Anandaiah has been using pepper, mulla vankaya and honey, Col Ramulu noted. He said that the preparation cannot be prescribed for Covid-19 as the formula is one among hundreds of local remedies for different ailments. Citing an instance, he pointed to the popular Puttur treatment for broken bones.
Col Ramulu said they would submit a report to the government on their study. It is up to the government to take a decision, he added.

"New Delhi: Romanian writer-director Radu Jude’s Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn opens with a naughty, kinky pornographic scene. Emi (Katia Pascariu), a school teacher, is having sex with her husband and they are recording the proceedings for a bit of extra thrill.
But somehow the sex tape leaks and is soon making the rounds of giggly WhatsApp groups of her students and their parents. Some download it, purportedly as evidence to beat Emi with. The fact that the sex is consensual, between a husband and wife is irrelevant. There is outrage, and it's mostly about how could a middle-aged, married woman be so raunchy.
 
Radu Jude’s film, which uses this porn clip and the subsequent ""trial"" of Emi in the school’s yard to draw circles around a society's hypocrisy, won the Golden Bear award for Best Film at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Friday.
The film is split in three parts. In the first, Loony Porn walks with Emi as she visits her school principal, goes to a book store and a pharmacy. Shot during the Coronavirus pandemic, this segment has visuals of a city all masked up and wary of social interactions. But it's also a city busy consuming, enraging, eradicating the past.
 
We watch arguments and fights in a supermarket, with owners of big cars who block the sidewalk as a matter of their right. Each clash is an assertion of the entitlement of the rich and marginalisation of others.
The film’s second part is polyphonic and here, through commentary, archival footage, statistics, words, nudes in newspapers, building rising and in ruins, Loony Porn tells the story of Romania — about its role in the Holocaust, its attitude to Jews, Romas, love for dictators, attitude to sex and children. It also tells us that in Romania, 6 out of 10 kids are subjected to family violence.
 
This fact hovers over the film's last segment -- the meeting called by the school principal and parents to interrogate and then vote on Emi’s future. It is kicked off by a parent who insists on playing the sex clip for the benefit of all those gathered.
This scene, framed like an inquisition — the ""accused"" is in the middle, flanked by a judge who will rule based on the mood of the people and the enforcer of morality — is both dark and funny. Though allegations, tangential discussions, innuendoes, inappropriate remarks, shrill sanctimony and, finally, the judgment, Loony Porn lays bare a nation that has revised its history to legitimise its past and current criminal acts and feels emboldened to air its prejudice, bigotry and misplaced rage. Because many speak in the same tongue, collective hypocrisy gets elevated to a sanctimonious, narcissistic chorus.  
 
What's striking is how familiar it all feels. This searing portrait of a nation and its people could well be a day in the life of India.

The film’s second part is polyphonic and here, through commentary, archival footage, statistics, words, nudes in newspapers, building rising and in ruins, Loony Porn tells the story of Romania — about its role in the Holocaust, its attitude to Jews, Romas, love for dictators, attitude to sex and children. It also tells us that in Romania, 6 out of 10 kids are subjected to family violence.
 
This fact hovers over the film's last segment -- the meeting called by the school principal and parents to interrogate and then vote on Emi’s future. It is kicked off by a parent who insists on playing the sex clip for the benefit of all those gathered.
This scene, framed like an inquisition — the ""accused"" is in the middle, flanked by a judge who will rule based on the mood of the people and the enforcer of morality — is both dark and funny. Though allegations, tangential discussions, innuendoes, inappropriate remarks, shrill sanctimony and, finally, the judgment, Loony Porn lays bare a nation that has revised its history to legitimise its past and current criminal acts and feels emboldened to air its prejudice, bigotry and misplaced rage. Because many speak in the same tongue, collective hypocrisy gets elevated to a sanctimonious, narcissistic chorus.  
 
What's striking is how familiar it all feels. This searing portrait of a nation and its people could well be a day in the life of India.

"Hyderabad: On turning 43 in May two year ago, Pushpak, a highly successful senior executive with a global fin-tech firm located in the Financial District, made several changes in his lifestyle. These included getting a farm house in the town, buying a new SUV and promising to block his calendar for a family holiday abroad.
His fitness goals included joining a gym, cycling and running. His life revolved around the stress of managing his own wealth portfolio as also his financial goals and ambitions.
 
Two years later, the SUV means far less to him. His farmhouse seems a trifle less important.
He has lost two members in his extended family, a close friend and several friends. He has failed at least in one case; despite all the money, he failed to get an ICU bed for a close relative in another city.
He now has a new priority; having peace of mind. After many trials, he has chosen an unlikely route – meditation – to achieve his goal.
Speaking on the eve of World Meditation Day, Pushpak says, “I knew it but missed the significance of such an elementary truth in life. Life is all about breathing. We breathe, we are alive. For all my life, I took it for granted. Today, anxiety and stress, fear and worry are all taking a toll on my life. Corona has raised questions on what we thought was our success. The calm of being aware of my own breath has been the greatest learning.”
 
He’s alone now. Hordes of people have been forced by the pandemic and its continuing challenges to seek and find mental peace through meditation.
Kamala Chirravuri, one of the top-notch yoga meditation teachers in Hyderabad, has celebrities -- those with serious mental issues and corporate executives -- seeking her help. She offers them counseling and personalized yoga-meditation solutions.
“Meditation as defined by Patanjali comprises dharana and dhyana. Dharana is singularly focusing all our conscious attention on one object, the starting point of meditation. Dhyana is the highest level we can achieve, wherein we are immersed and become one with the flow,” she says.
 
When asked about her heightened interest in meditation, Kamala replies, “It feels like we are in the midst of a mythological pralaya. To face the unrest outside, we must find strength, peace and calm within. Once we learn to focus our attention within, and become aware of our breath, we find a center and we reduce the imbalance that causes stress, anxiety and unrest.”
A trainer in the Krishnamacharya tradition, Kamala is comfortable with the diversity of meditation techniques. “There are many techniques from Vipassana, the focus on breath and sensations, to chanting of ‘Om’ to visualizations. Anything that works for you! But the one constant in life is our breathing.”
 
Sanjay Sehgal, a director at Heartfulness, says, “In our technique, we begin with thought as a focal point and dive deeper into the heart. This is a 76-years-old technique of diving deeper and achieving a higher level of consciousness.”
He says, “People may reach out for various reasons. Relieving your stress or finding peace is easy. I often say, you can find peace with a peg of good whiskey or if you can avoid fighting with your spouse. But finding sustainable inner peace, to be a better person, is harder, which is where we take you to.”
 
The heart-centred meditation, which has millions of practitioners, over 14,000 trainers and over 260 ashrams in 130 nations, renders its service all free.
When quizzed about the recent spurt in interest, Sehgal says, “Even a basic practice of pranayamam will help you at a physical level. It expands your lungs and eases the flow of air from your nose to inside. It can most certainly help during Covid times. Bad things can happen to anyone. But a great gift of meditation is that it helps you alter and find a better sense of control over your own reactions and responses. I have seen in my own family that those who meditate had a distinctly different and qualitatively better response to the emergencies arising out of the Covid pandemic than to those who don’t meditate.”
 
Trainers have adopted technology in the Covid season to ensure that meditation can be taught in the virtual mode. From an institutional meditation like Heartfulness, whose global headquarters is in Hyderabad and whose spiritual leader Daaji has held remote virtual sessions to individual trainers like Kamala, to those who are doing sessions through Zoom or Google Meets, technology is helping bring together the agitated with those who guide you to inner peace.

"The women of today are focused, feisty and raring to go in pursuit of their true calling. And nothing seems to be holding them back. Because she knows exactly what she wants and is growing increasingly immune to petty criticism and stereotypical judgements.
In a fun chat, a bunch of women speak about the inanest comments that came their way when they chose to follow their heart. And what needs to change, as we celebrate another year of Women’s Day!
 
Don’t need sympathy
I am not a propagator of pushing or breaking the glass ceiling. We harp on and on about the fictional glass ceiling. In my opinion, we create our own reality by owning up to our actions. What glass ceiling are we talking about? It has always been a self-fulfilling prophecy. On one hand, we’re always talking about equality and on the other we expect praise for being a woman entrepreneur. Just like you have ‘a boss’ — not a woman boss or a male boss — you’re an entrepreneur, irrespective of gender. The term ‘woman entrepreneur’ is redundant. Your goals don’t know or care about your gender. Just keep going and rise through to where you ought to be.”
Ami Sata, Founder, Amouve
 
Be happy
One should follow their own soul’s calling. I’ve been told I was a dreamer, crazy, irresponsible and ungrounded just because I chose to do what made me happy. Women are questioned a lot more about their choices, and I really hope that changes. Most women today in my opinion are looking for freedom — and being able to do what you like is true freedom.”

A male acquaintance once said to me, out of the blue, ‘Honestly, Sanhita, I think you are trying too hard. You could have just put on some make-up, and dressed well and got married to a rich guy so that you don’t have to do anything and enjoy a luxurious life’.
I’ve often been asked when is my Chick Lit book coming out. This women’s day I wish we are inclusive of all genders when we make decisions. But above all, I wish that we are able to create a safe society which is more accepting of all kinds of people so that in the future we no longer need to celebrate a certain day to remind people of what more needs to be done to benefit us all.”

Take charge of your life
I have heard many comments like ‘That’s interesting! What else do you do?’ Another regular comment is, ‘You must not be married. That’s why you are able to do all this. See how things change after marriage...’.
Truth is I’ve been married for 10 years now. My wish for every woman is to be able to take charge of their lives and be aware of their own capabilities, irrespective of people’s perceptions about them or what they do.”

Freedom from bias
It’s high time people start to take fledgling women entrepreneurs seriously. I was once told that I could enjoy and have fun in life on the pretext of ‘entrepreneurship.’ These were their exact words, ‘No one will even question you. But if you are really serious, then let me tell you, building a sustainable business is not everyone’s cup of tea.’
So, from my experience, when women talk about wanting and finding freedom, it actually starts with the need for freedom against bias and stereotyping.”

"Hyderabad: A few organisations are striving hard to make sure that frontline warriors against Covid-19 pandemic and other caregivers are not deprived of food, groceries and other bare necessities during their fight against the pandemic.
One such organisation, Give Hope Foundation, in association with a privately operated restaurant, started a campaign to help frontline Covid workers each day. As a part of its drive, the members of the organisation are providing protective gear, masks and nutritious healthy meals to them. Anybody can participate and donate groceries and other food items by scanning the Give Hope Foundation QR code.
 
Speaking to this newspaper, Vasumana Ghosh, a representative of the organisation said, “We have been active for some time, but in the last two weeks we have had some tremendous response for the drive.”
“We have conducted various activities like supplying food and groceries to at old-age homes, orphanages, GHMC workers and schools during these Covid times,” she said.  
During the pandemic, the group has distributed Rs 1.5 lakh worth masks and sanitisers to law and order departments, traffic police, GHMC workers and sanitation workers, she added.

"Hyderabad: First there were the mice, and some rats. Then came Syrian hamsters and the rabbits. And finally there were the rhesus macaque monkeys. The lakhs of people receiving Covaxin to keep themselves safe from Covid-19, and to help stop the spread of the disease in India and elsewhere in the world, have much to thank these animals for.
Not just because these animals were the first ones to receive the jabs of the three vaccine candidates developed by scientists at the Bharat Biotech, along with Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).
 
Not just because the animals were deliberately injected with the SARS-CoV-2 to test the efficacy of the candidate vaccines while in their cages in a high security Level 4 biosafety hazard lab at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.
But because at the end of the study periods, each of them was put to sleep for ever before necropsies were performed on their bodies by the scientists who studied what the virus did to the animals and their organs, and how the vaccine candidates worked in controlling the virus in their bodies.
All these animals, unknown to anyone outside of the NIV lab or the scientists involved in the vaccine development — in human terms — made the ultimate sacrifice of giving up their lives so the very humans who put them through the trials, could keep themselves safe from the virus that probably racked their fragile bodies as the vaccines and the virus battled it out in their organs.
 
In three studies, scientists from Bharat Biotech, NIV and ICMR provide great detail about how the trial were conducted, and how the immune response for the candidate vaccines — three versions of the then under-development (during the peak of the lockdown in 2020) Bharat Biotech’s vaccine — was in these animals.
There is a reason why lab grown rats, mice, Syrian hamsters, and rabbits are chosen for the studies. As is also the case with the rhesus macaques. The manner in which the immune responses to a virus in these animals develop, is very close to how a human body responds to a virus. And therein lies the value of testing vaccine candidates on these animals even if it means injecting them with the virus to study how their bodies respond and how the vaccines work in controlling the virus in them.
 
Once the trial is over, even if it is possible to extract tissue samples from various organs without actually killing the animals, their subsequent upkeep and nursing them back to health is a hard task. Since these animals are bred for the express purpose of testing in labs, with the exception of the monkeys, and once the tests are completed they are of no further use for any other tests, they are put to sleep in the most humane way possible, according to a senior scientist well versed with the strict protocols that govern use of animals in labs for such tests.
 
While the rats, mice, rabbits and Syrian hamsters were lab-bred, the rhesus macaques that were used in testing Covaxin candidates were caught in the wild in Maharashtra.
According to the study on the tests conducted on the monkeys, permission from the Office of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Maharashtra state, was obtained for capturing 30 rhesus macaques from the wild. Because a decline in the macaque population was observed in the permitted areas of Maharashtra due to the habitat change “probably imposed by food scarcity during the Covid-19 lockdown period of India (March 25, 2020, till May 31, 2020),” 20 of them — 12 males and 8 females — “were captured using experienced monkey catchers,” the study reported. The research was conducted in compliance with the guidelines laid down by the Committee for the Purpose of Control And Supervision of Experiments on Animals, Government of India, the study said.

"HYDERABAD: The air inside is cool, but thick with Coronavirus. Among the 13 patients in a Covid-19 ICU, some are on ventilators as their bodies wracked by the virus try and fight back the disease.
The sight is pathetic. The tube inside the throat adds to their cough. Each time a patient coughs, countless virus particles are spewed into the air.
 
Inside the blue full body protection kits, doctors, nurses and other support staff go about their tasks methodically. At stake are the lives of infected patients who, along with their families, have placed their faith in god the almighty and the hospital staff.
The staff in attendance is practising a new regimen of long shifts on slim meals and controlled fluid intake. “If anyone wants to take a break, they will take off the PPE kits and spend 20 minutes in the restroom and spend another 20 minutes putting on a fresh kit. In the meanwhile, we need to find a replacement for that person for a similar duration,” explained Dr K. Subba Reddy, chief intensivist at Apollo Hospital.
 
Last year, when patients began streaming into the ICU at Apollo in Jubilee Hills, there was fear and apprehension among the staff. Everyone was worried and scared. It was Annapurna, a senior housekeeping staffer, who gave the medics the confidence to carry on.
“I had attended to the requirements of TB, AIDS and Chicken Pox patients. We overcame those situations with courage and we can overcome this too,” she had told them. “That gave us a lot of motivation and strength. Then there was one of our nurses Pyun Su Klin, who lost her sister and brother in the first wave. Yet, she said she will not take a break or go home, but continued to work, saying there were so many pat-ients around to be taken care of,” Dr Subba Reddy recalled. While the stress of working to save lives every minute is itself a challenging experience, so is it that an ICU staffer cannot mingle with own family as a matter of precaution.
 
The air in a Covid-19 ICU is thick with the virus. Intubated patients are coughing, generating aerosols carrying the virus particles.
Subba Reddy, over the past one year, has only been seeing his 11-year-old daughter from a distance, in a different apartment where she lives with her grandparents. Going nearer meant a risk to the child.
Coming off a prolonged 72-hour shift, Dr K. Swarna Deepak, also of Apollo, told Deccan Chronicle on Sunday: “Sometimes you just cannot take a break. Over the last couple of days, we opened more ICUs for Covid patients.”
 
And if a hospital runs out of ventilators, the doctors and nurses would resort to sheer physical stamina, drawing every ounce of strength they have to keep a patient alive.
Using a bag ventilator, they keep pumping, squeezing the bag to push oxygen into a patient’s lungs. “And when one arm gets tired, you just switch arms and continue. As long as it takes,” Dr Deepak said.
Elsewhere, at KIMS hospital, Dr Sambit Sahu, a critical and intensive care specialist, talks wistfully of what the scene was just a few weeks ago. “We barely had three patients in the Covid19 ICU. Then it hit us like a storm. All of a sudden, it was 50 patients; and by the time we realised what was happening, we had a 100 of them in these ICUs,” he said.
 
Unlike last year, Covid19 was a novel disease and what everyone heard about it came from other parts of the world. The second wave is different. There was a sense of mental fatigue, of coming out of a stressful year. “We just got out of a traumatic year. And the feeling as the patients began pouring in was Oh God! Not Again!,” Dr Sahu said.
As the virus keeps flying around in the ICUs, the doctors have just one prayer on their lips; that they be able to save the life of every patient and that people at large followed the safety measures and helped medical professionals by keeping the case loads low.
 
“If that does not happen soon, we are in for a disaster,” said Dr Subba Reddy.

"New Delhi: Evil is beguiling, evil geniuses more so. They excite us like tantalising puzzles that we want to examine and solve.  
Writers, film directors, theatre owners and audiences are almost like law enforcement officers in their pursuit to understand psychopaths and that’s why they keep revisiting terrorists, serial killers, rapists -- for yet another peek into their minds, their homes, their rage, and their crimes.
 
But, psychopaths are also cliches.
Almost every exploration of a criminal mind that's been mounted on the big screen or split into episodes for OTT platforms is a trek down a familiar road. En route there are absentee or overbearing parents. Some physical or emotional abuse. There’s unease in mundane, social situations. Solace in solitude. And there’s almost, always, sexual frustration.
Given this template, there is nothing exceptional in the story of Theodore Kaczynski, or as he is better known, Ted Kaczynski, America’s Unabomber. And yet, writer-director Tony Stone’s film Ted K, which had its world premiere at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Monday, stands out.
 
To tell the story of the Unabomber, Stone uses real television clips, Kaczynski’s writings, diary entries — which were copious and in numerical code — and meshes them with an intense, bravura performance by Sharlto Copley.
The South African actor, known for his performance as Wikus van der Merwe in the 2009 science fiction film District 9, carries Ted K with a meticulously studied but intense act that is as discomforting as it is impressive.
He remains in an unrelenting wired state throughout, whether he is raging against the whirring helicopters overhead, the pillage of the earth around him, building a bomb or complaining to a telephone company official about the $5 and few cents that a public phone owes him.
 
We watch, in his body and face, as his complexes, sense of superiority, frustration turn into a raging, mad desire to seek revenge on corporates, technology, one parcel bomb at a time.
Great performances, especially in biopics, are marked by that moment when the actor becomes the character, embodying and portraying all the ugliness and physicality while creating an inner cosmos that we can read in their eyes, in the tiniest change of expression.
Copley as Kaczynski, a mathematics prodigy who joined Harvard University at the age of 16 but then checked out to live by himself in Montana mountains in a 10-by-12 wood cabin, is on the screen throughout. Except for a few brief scenes in the 120-minute film, the camera stays on Copley and there is not a single false note in his compelling act.
 
Among the younger lot in Hollywood, Christian Bale, Leonado de Caprio, Matthew McConaughey, Javier Bardem, Joaquin Phoenix, James Franco and Bradley Cooper are names taken with reverence in terms of how much they give of themselves to a role.
Difficult films with demanding roles can ride on them.
To that hall of fame, Ted K adds the name of Sharlto Copley. He creates the sort of scary, uneasy portrait of a man in constant distress and rage that won’t ever leave you.

"HYDERABAD: Doctors and nurses attending to Covid-19 patients and posting their videos on social media sum up the trauma they experience in Covid wards, where the pandemic is staging a dance of death and devastation. End of the day, they often break down into tears.
Medical professionals handling the dying patients say counseling their families on the wait outside is itself a huge task and painful experience. Cases are one too many, hospitals are running out of beds, there is shortage of support systems and life-saving equipment, and the virus’s variants are often difficult to identify.
 
The medical staff is face-to-face with death and strained also by the extra hours of work day after day, in iterations. Worse, they are exposed closer to this deadly virus than the general public.
Many doctors, nurses and other medical staff have lost their lives while treating the patients. Here is a war-like situation. They are also scared about the possibility that they carry the killer virus home and spread it to the family.
Alongside comes the people’s irresponsible behavior, couldn’t-care-less attitude, the mass gatherings, political rallies, cinema craze, all helping spread the deadly virus. All these are happening when the frontline Covid warriors are staking their lives and attending to patients non-stop and gasping for breath.
 
Dr Anita Rego, mental health professional and psychotherapist, said: “As frontline workers they deal with the real miseries of the patients, those who are struggling on their beds, those who are breathing their last. The stories of medical success are often clouded by these realities. We need to build an envelope of caring professionals and psychotherapists on whom they can fall back and build their strength and energy.”
She added: “Providing healthcare workers with stronger networks of specialist mental health services is not yet a priority with our health system and we need to advocate it.”
 
Dr Daljeet Kaur, consultant psychiatrist, said: “There will be frustration, stress and anxiety. The medical staff is disheartened because the situation is not in their control. When it comes to the doctors’ level, the coronavirus variants are unpredictable and it is difficult for them to understand the prognosis of patients.”
“The stress level, though, varies between individual and individual. While a senior doctor might be stressed and overwhelmed, a nursing staff or paramedic on the frontline and spending more time with the patient is more depressed seeing the conditions from close quarters.”
 
She suggested: “Counselors should be allocated for patients and the attenders. This will reduce the load of the consulting doctors. The medical staff should also be counseled on a periodical basis. Mental health of the medical staff should be a priority.”
 
QUOTES
Dr J Shivkumar, senior cardiologist: “The medical professionals are always under stress due to various reasons. Now, in the Covid situation, they are putting their lives on stake and saving the patient, whereas the general public is game with flaunting all the Covid protocols, further straining the health sector facilities.”
 
Dr Ashish Chauhan, Covid care expert at Apollo Hospital: “With an exposure some 100 to 1,000 times more that of the general public, the health care professionals are dead scared while performing their duties. Currently they are working like a soldier, ready to be martyred during a war. A sincere thanks by the patients and their relatives is what they expect.” 
“As per an IMA study, an average Indian doctor lives 10 years lesser than the normal population. Now, some 70 to 80 per cent of the patients are treated and they walkout healthy whereas some 20 to 30 per cent die. This is not an easy sight to digest.”
 
Dr  Karuna Madap, paediatrician, Covid-care: “Health care warriors should protect themselves and their families first. If they are physically and mentally strong, they can take care of hundreds patients. The medical staff should constantly take proper counseling for their mental health from a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist. There should be some organisation to come forward and provide nutritious food for the medical staff.”
Dr Sahithi Reddy Lebaka, junior doctor at Fever Hospital, Nallakunta: “Wearing plastic PPE kits for hours in his summer is not an easy task. Restless extra shifts due to constant patient flow, insufficient medical supplies and instruments, all these mean for us a mental fatigue.”
 
Dr M A Faroqui, professor, PG department of Unani medicine, Tibbi College, Charminar: “On Wednesday, two doctors in this Unani hospital have perished due to Covid-19. Over time, we will be drained out. There has to be equal participation of the public to overcome the present grim situation. When that fails to happen, we become mentally upset.”
Laxman Rudavath, Telangana nursing officers association general secretary: “Nurses are the first to serve patients. Even in these deadly situations, we take care of patients to the best. As we see around too many deaths and when a lot of patients sufferings, we naturally get depressed. We also have a fear that we are taking home the virus to our family.”
 
Jyothi, staff nurse, King Koti Hospital (Covid Centre): “We are exposed to so much of trauma during this pandemic. There is a sudden spike in the cases. When we return home we are out of our mood. Yes, there should be some mental health counselors for the medical workers.”
Sarala Kancharla, staff nursem Gandhi Hospital (State-assigned Covid-19 hospital): “The pouring in of patients, all around us, it’s suffering and suffering…  the shortage of staff, lack of support, our exposure to this deadly virus, the constant fear of us getting infected, we are stressed a lot these days.”
 
Ravindar Reddy, sanitization supervisor: “This wave made many of us think: is this worth taking risk? We are also seeing discrimination near our place, we are very depressed these days, and yet work should go on.”
Haseena Begum, Ayah, Nelofer Hospital: “Seeing the sufferings of patients, especially little children who are infected by coronavirus, makes us more sad and these days we don’t even feel like eating. We all are so scared!”

"New Delhi: Romanian writer-director Radu Jude’s Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn opens with a naughty, kinky pornographic scene. Emi (Katia Pascariu), a school teacher, is having sex with her husband and they are recording the proceedings for a bit of extra thrill.
But somehow the sex tape leaks and is soon making the rounds of giggly WhatsApp groups of her students and their parents. Some download it, purportedly as evidence to beat Emi with. The fact that the sex is consensual, between a husband and wife is irrelevant. There is outrage, and it's mostly about how could a middle-aged, married woman be so raunchy.
 
Radu Jude’s film, which uses this porn clip and the subsequent ""trial"" of Emi in the school’s yard to draw circles around a society's hypocrisy, won the Golden Bear award for Best Film at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Friday.
The film is split in three parts. In the first, Loony Porn walks with Emi as she visits her school principal, goes to a book store and a pharmacy. Shot during the Coronavirus pandemic, this segment has visuals of a city all masked up and wary of social interactions. But it's also a city busy consuming, enraging, eradicating the past.
 
We watch arguments and fights in a supermarket, with owners of big cars who block the sidewalk as a matter of their right. Each clash is an assertion of the entitlement of the rich and marginalisation of others.
The film’s second part is polyphonic and here, through commentary, archival footage, statistics, words, nudes in newspapers, building rising and in ruins, Loony Porn tells the story of Romania — about its role in the Holocaust, its attitude to Jews, Romas, love for dictators, attitude to sex and children. It also tells us that in Romania, 6 out of 10 kids are subjected to family violence.
 
This fact hovers over the film's last segment -- the meeting called by the school principal and parents to interrogate and then vote on Emi’s future. It is kicked off by a parent who insists on playing the sex clip for the benefit of all those gathered.
This scene, framed like an inquisition — the ""accused"" is in the middle, flanked by a judge who will rule based on the mood of the people and the enforcer of morality — is both dark and funny. Though allegations, tangential discussions, innuendoes, inappropriate remarks, shrill sanctimony and, finally, the judgment, Loony Porn lays bare a nation that has revised its history to legitimise its past and current criminal acts and feels emboldened to air its prejudice, bigotry and misplaced rage. Because many speak in the same tongue, collective hypocrisy gets elevated to a sanctimonious, narcissistic chorus.  
 
What's striking is how familiar it all feels. This searing portrait of a nation and its people could well be a day in the life of India.

"Hyderabad: In the rapidly evolving field of healthcare protocols and advancements in treatments of various diseases and health conditions, two city doctors have been digging deep, down to the genetic information level, in a bid to ensure best possible outcomes for their patients.
“This is the next step in medical care,” says Dr Kalyan Uppuluri, from K&H Personalized Medicine Clinic. He, along with Dr Hima Challa, are the founders of the clinic, the first of its kind in the country to offer services bringing genomic medicine into clinical medicare. Armed with degrees in medical genomics from Stanford University and Harvard Medical School respectively, they say they took a leap of faith two years ago to set up their clinic in the city.
 
“There is enough data at the genetic level of humans to help modern medicine become more precise,” says Dr Hima Challa. “There is very strong objective evidence for this.”
The challenge for them was to translate molecular biology level data into medical language. A team of molecular biologists armed with advanced degrees dug deep into published research and after studying thousands of research papers, gathered data on around 8,000 genes and switched what each of them do and what that means in medical language. “For example, the gene that regulates glycogen provides information on how glucose is released when needed by the body. If there are disorders associated with this, this can be determined by genetic studies. If a person is prone to this problem, then advise can be given that he or she needs to consume carbohydrates before exercises or workouts so energy is available for these tasks,” Dr Hima Challa explained.
 
Genomic medicine helps in determining risk scores for various possible health conditions and these scores remain more or less stable through one’s life. Clinical risk scores can change, and can be changed for the better based on follow up advice from physicians, especially when coupled with knowledge of the genetic risk scores, she says.
“Our view is that personalized medicine is the future. Patients will be in a position, when their doctors have the assistance of genomic medicine, to be assured that they are in a position to achieve the best possible outcomes for their treatment,” says Dr Kalyan Uppuluri.
 
Medicines of the future will evolve based on genomics, he predicts. “We see this already in oncology, for treating cancers. Genomics is already helping in attacking this disease’s pathways,” he says.
On what the future holds, he says that they see their clinic offering their products based on algorithms developed based on genetic information they have complied as well as from their patients so far, to support clinics and hospitals. If clinical medicine is combined with genomic medicine and with proper follow-ups by patients, the treatment outcomes will be much better, help patients overcome their disease and help their doctors prescribe protocols that can better combat their conditions, he says.

"Hyderabad: A recently launched biography of the late N.T. Rama Rao, titled 'Maverick Messaiah', written by journalist Ramesh Kandula, chronicles and analyses the political life of NTR and its impact on both the state and the nation. An objective assessment of the late leader, the book has been well-received for its critical insight and diligent research.
What set NTR apart from later day movie stars entering politics? Is the Telugu Desam a Kamma party meant to empower the community and is it dying? In this two-part interview with Sriram Karri, author Kandula defends the party and explains what set NTR apart.
 
Why did NTR remain the last real actor phenomenon to achieve political success? Tamil superstar Rajanikant has now announced he won’t enter politics, while Chiranjeevi and Pawan Kalyan had great fan networks but could not convert them into political parties that could debut with electoral wins.
Film actors who entered politics in the past, especially M.G. Ramachandran (MGR) and later on, N.T. Rama Rao (NTR), had a strong artistic urge to connect with the people. The social bonding they enjoyed with their audiences was qualitatively different from actors who strayed into politics in recent years. Despite enormous adulation they enjoyed, neither MGR nor NTR took the people for granted when entering politics. Unlike MGR, NTR did not have a political pedigree, but spared no effort in understanding and articulating public issues that impacted the masses.
 
Chiranjeevi enjoyed many advantages but failed to convince the voting public that he was an alternative to the existing set-up. His campaign began with an assumption that he was a chief-minister-in-waiting and he had to just walk through elections to occupy the chair.
While NTR used his celluloid image to reach out to the public, he never relied on his glamour alone. The political content of NTR’s campaign was more focused and serious, while Chiranjeevi’s was more style than substance. I think Pawan Kalyan also suffers from the same failings (as his brother). Actors cannot succeed in politics unless they carry a serious political message.
 
Did the kind of films NTR played, particularly mythologies, give him any advantage? Why did he have such high credibility with masses? What in your estimate justifies calling him a messiah of any kind, even if of a maverick kind?
An interesting aspect of NTR's mythologies were that they were pan-Indian stories, and not directly related to Telugu nationalism and pride that NTR propounded politically. During NTR’s time, screen adaptations of mythologies became known for a distinctive Telugu, which was formal and ceremonial. As several researchers have pointed out, NTR's mastery over language, considered a quintessential Telugu experience, did help in his emergence as a Telugu cultural symbol.
 
My hypothesis is that NTR carried over the linguistic identity of these films into his political campaign, but not his screen 'divinity'. His political credibility was not a by-product of his playing godly characters. He worked towards it consciously both in his film career and later on in politics.
As for the tag of messiah, NTR burst on to the political scene in 1982 as a ray of hope and captivated the imagination of the Telugus like no other leader. His campaigns were the greatest spectacles of democracy in action. Shortcomings notwithstanding, NTR emerged as a larger-than-life personality and brought a sea-change in the socio-political landscape of AP.
 
The maverick apart, NTR was a man of strange contradictions. He believed in the power of people, but his democratic credentials were suspect because he had no qualms in turning his party into a one-man show. He was secular to the core but exhibited a peculiar religious streak. He entered politics on the plank of regionalism but remained a committed nationalist throughout.
How did people relate to his dramatics and eccentricities?
His dramatics entertained the masses but some sections of people intensely disliked the theatrics he brought into politics. He carried this urge to be the centre of attraction from reel to public life. However, common folks were not particularly put off by this, because of his ability to convey seriousness of intent. Despite the nickname 'Drama Rao', NTR was a very serious man in private and rarely cracked a joke. But a common person felt warmth in his presence.

"The women of today are focused, feisty and raring to go in pursuit of their true calling. And nothing seems to be holding them back. Because she knows exactly what she wants and is growing increasingly immune to petty criticism and stereotypical judgements.
In a fun chat, a bunch of women speak about the inanest comments that came their way when they chose to follow their heart. And what needs to change, as we celebrate another year of Women’s Day!
 
Don’t need sympathy
I am not a propagator of pushing or breaking the glass ceiling. We harp on and on about the fictional glass ceiling. In my opinion, we create our own reality by owning up to our actions. What glass ceiling are we talking about? It has always been a self-fulfilling prophecy. On one hand, we’re always talking about equality and on the other we expect praise for being a woman entrepreneur. Just like you have ‘a boss’ — not a woman boss or a male boss — you’re an entrepreneur, irrespective of gender. The term ‘woman entrepreneur’ is redundant. Your goals don’t know or care about your gender. Just keep going and rise through to where you ought to be.”
Ami Sata, Founder, Amouve
 
Be happy
One should follow their own soul’s calling. I’ve been told I was a dreamer, crazy, irresponsible and ungrounded just because I chose to do what made me happy. Women are questioned a lot more about their choices, and I really hope that changes. Most women today in my opinion are looking for freedom — and being able to do what you like is true freedom.”
Sheelaa Bajaj, Celebrity numerologist
No room for regression
A male acquaintance once said to me, out of the blue, ‘Honestly, Sanhita, I think you are trying too hard. You could have just put on some make-up, and dressed well and got married to a rich guy so that you don’t have to do anything and enjoy a luxurious life’.
I’ve often been asked when is my Chick Lit book coming out. This women’s day I wish we are inclusive of all genders when we make decisions. But above all, I wish that we are able to create a safe society which is more accepting of all kinds of people so that in the future we no longer need to celebrate a certain day to remind people of what more needs to be done to benefit us all.”
Sanhita Baruah,best-selling author of The Art of Letting Go in Amazon’s poetry category, 2020
 
Take charge of your life
I have heard many comments like ‘That’s interesting! What else do you do?’ Another regular comment is, ‘You must not be married. That’s why you are able to do all this. See how things change after marriage...’.
Truth is I’ve been married for 10 years now. My wish for every woman is to be able to take charge of their lives and be aware of their own capabilities, irrespective of people’s perceptions about them or what they do.”
Shambhavi Singh, (Runs Kaushalya.mantra, a wellness start-up, focuses on holistic health)
 
Freedom from bias
It’s high time people start to take fledgling women entrepreneurs seriously. I was once told that I could enjoy and have fun in life on the pretext of ‘entrepreneurship.’ These were their exact words, ‘No one will even question you. But if you are really serious, then let me tell you, building a sustainable business is not everyone’s cup of tea.’
So, from my experience, when women talk about wanting and finding freedom, it actually starts with the need for freedom against bias and stereotyping.”

"Hyderabad: First there were the mice, and some rats. Then came Syrian hamsters and the rabbits. And finally there were the rhesus macaque monkeys. The lakhs of people receiving Covaxin to keep themselves safe from Covid-19, and to help stop the spread of the disease in India and elsewhere in the world, have much to thank these animals for.
Not just because these animals were the first ones to receive the jabs of the three vaccine candidates developed by scientists at the Bharat Biotech, along with Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).
 
Not just because the animals were deliberately injected with the SARS-CoV-2 to test the efficacy of the candidate vaccines while in their cages in a high security Level 4 biosafety hazard lab at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.
But because at the end of the study periods, each of them was put to sleep for ever before necropsies were performed on their bodies by the scientists who studied what the virus did to the animals and their organs, and how the vaccine candidates worked in controlling the virus in their bodies.
All these animals, unknown to anyone outside of the NIV lab or the scientists involved in the vaccine development — in human terms — made the ultimate sacrifice of giving up their lives so the very humans who put them through the trials, could keep themselves safe from the virus that probably racked their fragile bodies as the vaccines and the virus battled it out in their organs.
 
In three studies, scientists from Bharat Biotech, NIV and ICMR provide great detail about how the trial were conducted, and how the immune response for the candidate vaccines — three versions of the then under-development (during the peak of the lockdown in 2020) Bharat Biotech’s vaccine — was in these animals.
There is a reason why lab grown rats, mice, Syrian hamsters, and rabbits are chosen for the studies. As is also the case with the rhesus macaques. The manner in which the immune responses to a virus in these animals develop, is very close to how a human body responds to a virus. And therein lies the value of testing vaccine candidates on these animals even if it means injecting them with the virus to study how their bodies respond and how the vaccines work in controlling the virus in them.
 
Once the trial is over, even if it is possible to extract tissue samples from various organs without actually killing the animals, their subsequent upkeep and nursing them back to health is a hard task. Since these animals are bred for the express purpose of testing in labs, with the exception of the monkeys, and once the tests are completed they are of no further use for any other tests, they are put to sleep in the most humane way possible, according to a senior scientist well versed with the strict protocols that govern use of animals in labs for such tests.
 
While the rats, mice, rabbits and Syrian hamsters were lab-bred, the rhesus macaques that were used in testing Covaxin candidates were caught in the wild in Maharashtra.
According to the study on the tests conducted on the monkeys, permission from the Office of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Maharashtra state, was obtained for capturing 30 rhesus macaques from the wild. Because a decline in the macaque population was observed in the permitted areas of Maharashtra due to the habitat change “probably imposed by food scarcity during the Covid-19 lockdown period of India (March 25, 2020, till May 31, 2020),” 20 of them — 12 males and 8 females — “were captured using experienced monkey catchers,” the study reported. The research was conducted in compliance with the guidelines laid down by the Committee for the Purpose of Control And Supervision of Experiments on Animals, Government of India, the study said.

"New Delhi: Evil is beguiling, evil geniuses more so. They excite us like tantalising puzzles that we want to examine and solve.  
Writers, film directors, theatre owners and audiences are almost like law enforcement officers in their pursuit to understand psychopaths and that’s why they keep revisiting terrorists, serial killers, rapists -- for yet another peek into their minds, their homes, their rage, and their crimes.
 
But, psychopaths are also cliches.
Almost every exploration of a criminal mind that's been mounted on the big screen or split into episodes for OTT platforms is a trek down a familiar road. En route there are absentee or overbearing parents. Some physical or emotional abuse. There’s unease in mundane, social situations. Solace in solitude. And there’s almost, always, sexual frustration.
Given this template, there is nothing exceptional in the story of Theodore Kaczynski, or as he is better known, Ted Kaczynski, America’s Unabomber. And yet, writer-director Tony Stone’s film Ted K, which had its world premiere at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Monday, stands out.
 
To tell the story of the Unabomber, Stone uses real television clips, Kaczynski’s writings, diary entries — which were copious and in numerical code — and meshes them with an intense, bravura performance by Sharlto Copley.
The South African actor, known for his performance as Wikus van der Merwe in the 2009 science fiction film District 9, carries Ted K with a meticulously studied but intense act that is as discomforting as it is impressive.
He remains in an unrelenting wired state throughout, whether he is raging against the whirring helicopters overhead, the pillage of the earth around him, building a bomb or complaining to a telephone company official about the $5 and few cents that a public phone owes him.
 
We watch, in his body and face, as his complexes, sense of superiority, frustration turn into a raging, mad desire to seek revenge on corporates, technology, one parcel bomb at a time.
Great performances, especially in biopics, are marked by that moment when the actor becomes the character, embodying and portraying all the ugliness and physicality while creating an inner cosmos that we can read in their eyes, in the tiniest change of expression.
Copley as Kaczynski, a mathematics prodigy who joined Harvard University at the age of 16 but then checked out to live by himself in Montana mountains in a 10-by-12 wood cabin, is on the screen throughout. Except for a few brief scenes in the 120-minute film, the camera stays on Copley and there is not a single false note in his compelling act.
 
Among the younger lot in Hollywood, Christian Bale, Leonado de Caprio, Matthew McConaughey, Javier Bardem, Joaquin Phoenix, James Franco and Bradley Cooper are names taken with reverence in terms of how much they give of themselves to a role.
Difficult films with demanding roles can ride on them.
To that hall of fame, Ted K adds the name of Sharlto Copley. He creates the sort of scary, uneasy portrait of a man in constant distress and rage that won’t ever leave you.

"Hyderabad: A recently launched biography of the late N.T. Rama Rao, titled 'Maverick Messaiah', written by journalist Ramesh Kandula, chronicles and analyses the political life of NTR and its impact on both the state and the nation. An objective assessment of the late leader, the book has been well-received for its critical insight and diligent research.
What set NTR apart from later day movie stars entering politics? Is the Telugu Desam a Kamma party meant to empower the community and is it dying? In this two-part interview with Sriram Karri, author Kandula defends the party and explains what set NTR apart.
 
Why did NTR remain the last real actor phenomenon to achieve political success? Tamil superstar Rajanikant has now announced he won’t enter politics, while Chiranjeevi and Pawan Kalyan had great fan networks but could not convert them into political parties that could debut with electoral wins.
Film actors who entered politics in the past, especially M.G. Ramachandran (MGR) and later on, N.T. Rama Rao (NTR), had a strong artistic urge to connect with the people.

While NTR used his celluloid image to reach out to the public, he never relied on his glamour alone.

An interesting aspect of NTR's mythologies were that they were pan-Indian stories, and not directly related to Telugu nationalism and pride that NTR propounded politically. During NTR’s time, screen adaptations of mythologies became known for a distinctive Telugu, which was formal and ceremonial. As several researchers have pointed out, NTR's mastery over language, considered a quintessential Telugu experience, did help in his emergence as a Telugu cultural symbol.
 
My hypothesis is that NTR carried over the linguistic identity of these films into his political campaign, but not his screen 'divinity'. His political credibility was not a by-product of his playing godly characters. He worked towards it consciously both in his film career and later on in politics.
As for the tag of messiah, NTR burst on to the political scene in 1982 as a ray of hope and captivated the imagination of the Telugus like no other leader. His campaigns were the greatest spectacles of democracy in action. Shortcomings notwithstanding, NTR emerged as a larger-than-life personality and brought a sea-change in the socio-political landscape of AP.
 
The maverick apart, NTR was a man of strange contradictions. He believed in the power of people, but his democratic credentials were suspect because he had no qualms in turning his party into a one-man show. He was secular to the core but exhibited a peculiar religious streak. He entered politics on the plank of regionalism but remained a committed nationalist throughout.
How did people relate to his dramatics and eccentricities?
His dramatics entertained the masses but some sections of people intensely disliked the theatrics he brought into politics. He carried this urge to be the centre of attraction from reel to public life. However, common folks were not particularly put off by this, because of his ability to convey seriousness of intent. Despite the nickname 'Drama Rao', NTR was a very serious man in private and rarely cracked a joke. But a common person felt warmth in his presence.

"When actor and director Olivia Wilde, best known for her role in the TV series House, was snapped holding hands with singer Harry Styles, who is 10 years her junior, one fan tweeted, “If she has kids at home, but is out running around with a dude a decade younger during a pandemic, she belongs to the streets (sic).”
Such vitriol against the mother, who found a date during the pandemic! Another user on the microblogging site wrote, “should be taking care of her two kids instead of dating one (sic)”.
Apparently, women are all on notice — if you give birth to a child and are single, you must say goodbye to your physical needs. What’s worse, the keep-it-in-your-pants attitude has existed across all strata of society—celebs, women from emancipated homes, and you-name-it.
Pooja Srinivasaraja, director of a global food chain, points out how women are expected to adhere to many rules that somehow seem to place them in a moral compass. “Being pious and not expressing passion post a child is so culturally engrained in us. If a mother was to be single, her looking for love or a companion is almost scorned upon,” she spells out.
The double standards
However, unlike Olivia Wilde, who had to endure unsolicited moral instructions and condemnation from strangers on Twitter about her sexual affiliations, men are usually praised for their sexual desires. And that’s what advocate Malini says is the flaw in our thinking. “If men stray even while in a marriage, the world attributes it to his success, stress and even an incompatible wife. His friends too look up to him as being a talent of sorts. But when a woman who is separated but has kids even dares to look for love, not necessarily marriage, even her own pals can be judgmental,” she states.
As early as 1975, when Australian activist Anne Summers did a seminal feminism-oriented book, titled Damned Whores and God’s Police, it became an unexpected bestseller, selling more than 100,000 copies. The book makes an observation that the absence of a culture embracing women as being anything other than either devoted mothers or “bad girls” was the “major impediment to female rebellion, and that which keeps women physically and psychologically bound to their family-centered roles”.
Sexual suppositions
Even as recently as five years ago, reality star Kim Kardashian, mother to four children, was unscrupulously attacked for appearing nude on the cover of Paper magazine. “I normally don’t. But … you’re someone’s mother,” wrote the late actress Naya Rivera who died by drowning in July 2020. However, and perhaps thankfully, that remark found its share of critics too. For one, Rachel Khona, of the popular parenting blog Scary Mommy and writer for several publications including The New York Times, The Washington Post, Playboy, Penthouse, Maxim, and Cosmopolitan, hit back. “Are moms supposed to suddenly metamorphosis after they have a child? We should respect women’s sexuality the same way we do men’s,” she wrote.
Even US-based transgender icon Laverne Cox agrees that society can be rather judgmental towards women. “When a woman dates younger men, and especially if you’re a mother they’d say, ‘Maybe you should be spending some time with your children.’ Why can’t a single mum leave her kids to the father to attend to while she also looks to satiate her needs?” she points out.
Your passion, your choice
Professor Dr Saranya Jai, a specialist in gender and sexual studies, isn’t surprised that mothers are still facing this censorship and prejudice. “These conversations about sexuality and consent are essential and important, and the ability for women to be able to choose to do what they want with their own body, and have sexual lives that are not only to reproduce,” adds Dr Saranya.
“Just as racism exists, sexism will exist. We need more women to find their voices and be bold about their choices. Conviction and courage will do the trick. We needn’t be apologetic about wanting to lead fulfilling lives. Kids or otherwise, we have a right to our own happiness.”
— Raena Reddy, a feminist
“When a woman dates a man, and especially if you’re a mother they’d say, ‘Maybe you should be spending some time with your children.’ Why is the onus always on the mother to nurture? Why can’t a single mum leave her kids to the father to attend to while she also looks to satiate her needs?”

"Hyderabad: The past few weeks saw various rare astronomical events, the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction, the triple conjunction of Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn, the Moon passing Mars- but astronomy enthusiasts in the city say that it is no more a thrill to witness these space events, because of the city lights.
Light pollution is a menace in the city of Hyderabad which is killing the joy of looking up to the night sky, astronomy enthusiasts and scientists have complained. Praveen Suryavanshi, an amateur astronomer and educator said that just to witness a full dark sky, one now will have to travel as far as at least a 100 kms away from the city. 
 
""I and my friends from the astronomers society in the city witnessed the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction from our offices and homes respectively. I was in Hi-Tech city that day, and in the shots I managed to get from the event show the kind of pollution from city lights and even the dust that emcompasses the sky now"", said Praveen. He added that the big flood lights, the neon lights on billboards and malls till the Shamshabad area have added to the mess, especially in the last four to five years. ""These unnecessary lights and the continuous construction activities have spoiled the city skies so much that even the night sky reflects this light, and on most nights clouds are visible"", he said.  
 
Dr. BG Sidharth, Director of the Birla Planetarium said that the first observatory near the city at Rangapur, 65 kms from the city, has also been affected by the light pollution. ""Unless one is very far away, on a hill or mountain, practicing astronomy in today's time is difficult, which is why the astronomy community here is growing weaker"", he said. 
The Japal-Rangapur Observatory under Osmania University open for research and practical work for post-graduate and Ph.D students, as well as for the public, has had the effects of civilisation in the nearby villages, but still has its nights of clear skies, argued Dr. Shanti Priya, Head, Department of Astronomy, OU. However, she agreed that the kind of dark sky experience a few years ago, is something that this generation will never be able to get. 
 
""We have held observation classes in the past few weeks for the conjunction occurrences among other events, for our 40-50 PG and research students. The LED lights around have had an effect on the observatory, but if the government takes some measures to increase the scientific temper while keeping in view the convenience of people around, like installing LED light covers, it will solve the issue to a great extent"", said Dr. Shanti Priya.
According to the world light pollution map, the location of the Rangapur Observatory falls in a rural/suburban transition sky, where the galaxy M33 in Triangulum, a key indicator of sky conditions visible to the eye is difficult to see. Here in the city, the location of the Birla Science Center Observatory is one of the highest light polluted areas anywhere in the world, making it impossible to locate the M33 galaxy in the city sky. 
 
Astronomers in the city now demand that government must take steps to protect the few dark skies left in and around the city like the Kotpally Reservoir area near Ananthagiri Hills, the Pocharam Dam in Medak, the Pakhal lake near Warangal, the Laknavaram Lake area, among others, by making strict policies to restrict urbanisation and declare these spots as Natural Dark Sky Sites.
Amateur astronomers have also brought to light an Archeoastronomy Megalithic site, similar to the Stonehenge 200 kms from Hyderabad, which falls under the village of Mudumal in Mahabubnagar district, where dark skies can be witnessed clearly. They demand that these sites should be preserved and protected for astronomy enthusiasts.

"WASHINGTON: @realDonaldTrump, the Twitter feed that grew from the random musings of a reality TV star into the cudgel of an American president, has died. It was not quite 12 years old.
The provocative handle was given birth by a New York real estate tycoon who used it to help him become the 45th U.S. president. It began with a May 4, 2009, tweet promoting Donald Trump’s upcoming appearance on David Letterman’s show.
 
It died more than 57,000 tweets later, with Trump using some of his final postings on the powerful platform to commiserate with a pro-Trump mob that besieged the halls of Congress in a deadly assault as lawmakers were set to certify his defeat.
The account met its demise when Twitter announced Friday it was pulling the plug permanently on @realDonaldTrump, citing concern that Trump would use it for “further incitement of violence.” Trump retorted that he’d be “building out our own platform in the near future. We will not be SILENCED!”
 
Trump, a novice politician but seasoned salesman, realized the power of social media in ways that few other politicians did. And he wielded it with never-before-seen power to diminish his opponents, shape elections and mold reality — at least in the eyes of his supporters.
Early on, @realDonaldTrump seemed innocent enough. Its owner, who had prolific experience in marketing casinos, real estate and even Oreos, used the platform mostly to promote his books, media appearances and give friendly plugs to friends.
But as Trump began seriously toying with a White House run, it became a tool to scorch opponents and give shape to his nationalist, “America First” philosophy.
 
He deployed its venom equally, whether insulting celebrity enemies (Rosie O’Donnell was “crude, rude, obnoxious and dumb”) or or using xenophobia to malign a country (Britain is “trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem”).
Peter Costanzo, then an online marketing director for the publishing company putting out Trump’s book, “Think Like a Champion,” helped bring Trump to the platform.
Twitter was still in its infancy at the time. But Costanzo, who later came to work for The Associated Press, saw the then-140-character-per-message platform as a new tool that the real estate mogul could use to boost sales and reach a broader audience.
 
Costanzo was given seven minutes to make his pitch to Trump — “Not five minutes, not 10,” he recalled in a 2016 interview.
Trump liked what he heard.
“I said, ‘Let’s call you @realDonaldTrump — you’re the real Donald Trump,’” recalled Costanzo. “He thought about it for a minute and said: ‘I like it. Let’s do it.’”
Other than Trump’s family, no one seemed off-limits from his Twitter wrath. Trump attacked Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats, 2016 political rivals, current administration staffers, former administration staffers, the Republican Party and cable networks.
 
@realDonaldTrump was prolific: On days when its owner was particularly agitated, such as in the midst of impeachment proceedings, it pushed out more than 100 tweets.
In its most popular tweet, on Oct. 2, 2020, @realDonaldTrump announced that Trump and first lady Melania Trump had contracted the coronavirus. The post got 1.8 million likes and nearly 400,000 retweets, according to Factba.se., which tracks the president’s social media habits and commentary.
The account was used to announce firings. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson learned of his ouster in a tweet.
 
The account threatened adversaries in the most colorful terms. Before Trump “fell in love” with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un through secretly exchanged letters, Trump used Twitter to dub him “rocket man” and vowed to respond with “fire and fury” if the authoritarian dared attack the United States.
@realDonaldTrump frequently spread misleading, false and malicious assertions, such as the baseless ideas that protesters at Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings were paid by the liberal philanthropist George Soros and that November’s election was beset by voter fraud.
 
Trump often tweeted well past midnight and before dawn, a cathartic outlet for grievances (Witch hunt! Crooked Hillary, Russia, Russia, Russia, FAKE NEWS, and so on.) For the most part, @realDonaldTrump and its 280-character posts effectively allowed Trump to work around the Washington media establishment and amplify the message of allies.
Sometimes @realDonaldTrump stumbled. Trump deleted 1,166 tweets and, in his final months on the platform, had 471 tweets flagged by Twitter for misinformation, according to Factba.se.
In one of his most memorable Twitter stumbles, Trump in May 2017 sent (and later deleted) a cryptic post-midnight tweet that read “Despite the constant negative press covfefe.”
 
The gibberish set the Twitterverse afire with speculation. Theories included that the tweeter-in-chief had fallen asleep mid-message and that the man who once bragged of having “the best words” was adding a new word to the lexicon to properly describe collusion between Democrats and the press.
The mystery was never solved.
Sam Nunberg, a longtime — and now former — Trump adviser, said that in the summer of 2011, after Trump announced he wasn’t running in 2012 but wanted to remain relevant, his team decided to start using social media to boost his profile.
 
They chose to focus on Twitter, where he already had an account and several hundred thousand followers. Nunberg remembers sending Trump daily reports on his follower growth. Trump would sometimes hand it back with hand-written notes — “Why not more?” “Why so slow?”
They celebrated when they hit the million mark.
“Twitter definitely played a pivotal role in building Donald Trump as a political figure within Republican politics and he also greatly enjoyed it,” said Nunberg. “Remember he used to say: ‘I wanted to own a newspaper. This is great, it’s like a newspaper without the losses.’”
 
Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took to Twitter shortly after the platform banned @realDonaldTrump to note that it continues to allow Iran’s supreme leader “and numerous other dictatorial regimes” to use the platform, but cannot abide his father.
“Mao would be proud,” Trump Jr. scoffed.
In the end, @realDonaldTrump offered an in-the-moment peek into Trump’s state of mind over more than a decade, a period in which the “Apprentice” TV star transformed into the 45th American president.
 
Down the road, when historians look for a glimpse into Trump thoughts on the issues of his time -- anything from actress Kristen Stewart’s treatment of co-star Robert Pattinson to the president’s views on Russian meddling in the 2016 election — the first stop may inevitably be one of the many digital archives that have preserved the tweets of @realDonaldTrump.
With Trump, whatever the topic, there’s always a tweet for that.

"Pharma companies are madly competing with each other when it comes to finding the first effective vaccine against COVID-19. Because of its topical importance, this race is not just between corporate companies alone. It has expanded to being a global competition between various countries (at both centre and state levels) invoking geo-politics. This tight race against time for finding a vaccine to inoculate the whole world is unprecedented in human history.
High Stakes Involved
 
The sheer volume of expected sales for such a vaccine at the moment is breathtaking. It’s a big money game running into billions of dollars. Hence it is not a surprise that many companies want to win this jackpot. “COVID vaccine is going to be a life saving drug and its sales plus distribution should be considered from a humanitarian point of view. It should not be used as a tool for making exorbitant profits by companies to exploit the poor and needy,” explains K.K. Shailaja Teacher, Minister of Health and Social Welfare for Kerala.
 
“All nations need to be given licenses and granted equal opportunity in the production of these life saving vaccines. International agencies like the UN and International Court of Justice should consider intervening, if necessary, to give a level playing field for all countries on this global public health matter,” adds Shailaja, who has become a global female icon and role model in the fight against COVID.
Vaccine Stockpiling 
Rich and prosperous countries are giving advance orders to stockpile hundreds of millions of doses in advance. Poorer countries are unable to match on this hoarding race because of the astronomical costs involved.
 
Sudden stockpiling at present market prices by richer countries could ensure prices for vaccines not to drop in near future. This in turn would not make life easier for poorer countries. This pandemic and global vaccination drive is going to bring in a multi-faceted economics problem as well.
Who Pays for Vaccines: Government or People?
In health insurance driven countries, it is still unclear whether insurance companies would take care of the costs or whether their citizens will have to pay an additional premium for getting vaccinated. In European countries, there is no full clarity as to whether the state would bear all the costs for vaccinating the entire population. In African countries, it is not clear whether other richer countries or international organisations would step-in to help them.
 
Due to the severity of the circumstances, companies are requesting the FDA for an early deployment of vaccines even before the clinical trials end. The scientific data provided by these companies thus far show that their respective vaccines are indeed effective. However, the current clinical trials being carried out are not double blind, and therefore there is an ethical responsibility to let the volunteer know whether they are in the placebo group or not, once the study becomes unblind.

While vaccine availability will be one end-point, we should remember that distributing vaccines will take time and that we will need to maintain restrictions around physical distancing and masks for a good while to come
 
 
— Prof Gautam Menon, 
Infectious diseases modelling expert at Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai
India’s High Population and Centre/State Cooperation
In highly populated countries like India, it is going to be a huge budgetary challenge to inoculate more than a billion people. It is still not clear how the centre and state are going to share these huge costs. Generous donations from philanthropists might only cover some tens of millions of doses inside India which is still a small fraction of our population.
 
In limited budgetary constraints, how to pick and choose the subjects for free inoculation is another tricky subject. Besides all this, even political parties are trying to score brownie points as to where and when free vaccines will be given. It is not yet clear whether only the healthcare workers will be vaccinated or whether the whole general population will be included for free inoculation.
Vaccine Administering Challenges
In addition to direct costs of vaccines, there will be added logistical costs regarding its transportation, storage, administering etc. Vaccinating the whole of India uniformly in a short span of time is going to be a logistical nightmare.
 
Some states have higher budgets than others. Some states have more robust health care systems than others. Besides budget, the most crucial point is the cold chain challenge — i.e. retaining the efficacy of vaccines from point of manufacture to point of administering. Feasible cold chain management plays a key role in selecting one vaccine over a list of other available vaccines. Massive transportation and storage at a permissible range of deep freezing temperatures is a massive challenge in countries like India.
“While vaccine availability will be one end-point, we should remember that distributing vaccines will take time and that we will need to maintain restrictions around physical distancing and masks for a good while to come,” advises Prof Gautam Menon, infectious diseases modelling expert at Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.
 
Why Developing Vaccines Take Time?
 
Vaccine candidates are first tested in animal models (pre-clinical validation). Only the most promising will be carried on in a clinical trial. This trial proceeds step by step, involving an increasing number of human subjects.
“It begins with a small group of healthy volunteers (phase I). If the response to the vaccine is good (no severe side effect but a good immune response), the number will scale up involving hundreds (phase II) and later thousands of volunteers (phase III). It is a blind placebo-control trial: part of the volunteers receives the vaccine, the remaining receive a placebo but they don’t know in which group they are. The volunteers for phase III should be chosen in countries in which the virus is actively circulating because, to calculate the efficacy of the vaccine, you need to compare the number of infections in the vaccine group with the one in the placebo group. This is the stage in which the most advanced COVID-19 vaccines are,” explains Dr Giuditta De Lorenzo, a virologist at MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, UK.
 
At the end of the clinical trial, all the collected data are reviewed by the regulatory agency (i.e FDA or EMA). Only when the agency gives the final approval, the vaccine is considered safe enough to be introduced in the population as part of the vaccination programmes.
“Usually, all together, this takes several years but the speed of the COVID-19 vaccines development has been impressive. Never in history a vaccine reached phase III in such a short amount of time. That was possible because of new technologies available but mostly because the urgency of the situation justified a huge investment of money, a simplification of bureaucracy and the redirection of many resources to this project (putting on hiatus many other research projects). But as efficient as the system can be, there is still a physiological time that needs to be respected: to mount an immune response after the vaccine, to spot any possible side effects and, for the volunteers, to encounter the virus and confirm their protection.” adds Dr De Lorenzo, who works on latest viral research.
 
Fast Tracking — Pros and Cons
When this process is being fast tracked in the present circumstance, it will help to instill more confidence and less fear in the minds of the general public and COVID victims. However fast tracking this comes with its fair share of cons too. “Due to the severity of the circumstances, companies are requesting the FDA for an early deployment of vaccines even before the clinical trials end. The scientific data provided by these companies thus far show that their respective vaccines are indeed effective, and an early release absolutely makes sense. However, such an ‘emergency use’ approval will certainly compromise the ongoing clinical trials not only of these vaccines, but also for those which have just started. The current clinical trials being carried out are not double blind, and therefore there is an ethical responsibility to let the volunteer know whether they are in the placebo group or not, once the study becomes unblind.” elaborates Dr Sreejith Rajasekharan, a virologist at Laboratory of Molecular Virology, International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Italy.
 
None can be directly blamed in this context because the demand and pressure are unprecedented from various interest groups. “As soon as the vaccine will be made available, these volunteers have the right to take the vaccine, and therefore can no longer be included in the control group. If too many volunteers cross over, the study might not have sufficiently large control groups to obtain statistically significant results for certain long-term goals,” adds Dr Rajasekharan, virologist who was part of the team that sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome in early March 2020.

"Hyderabad: Sirisha Bandla, 34-year-old aeronautical engineer, is one among the 5 astronauts to fly into space with billionaire Richard Branson on board Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo Unity.
Bandla is also the third Indian-origin woman to head to space after Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams.
 
Born in Andhra Pradesh's Guntur and brought up in Houston, Texas, Bandla will join Branson and four others to make a journey to the space from New Mexico.
""I am so incredibly honored to be a part of the amazing crew of #Unity22, and to be a part of a company whose mission is to make space available to all,"" Bandla tweeted when the mission was announced.
""I really didn't need to tweet this since my friends flooded the feed yesterday with itRed heartI was overwhelmed (in a good way!) by messages of love, unrecognizable capital text, and positivity yesterday. Slowly working my way through them...one platform at a time!"" she added.

Bandla will be astronaut no 004 and her flight role will be Researcher Experience, according to her profile on Virgin Galactic.
""When I first heard that I was getting this opportunity, it was just. I think that that probably captured it very well, I was speechless. This is an incredible opportunity to get people from different backgrounds, different geographies and different communities into space,"" she said in a video posted on Virgin Galactic Twitter on July 6.
 
Speaking about the experience, Bandla said it was ""incredible"" and ""life-changing"" experience to see Earth from space.
""I am kind of still up there but it's so glad to be here. I was trying to think about a better word than incredible but that is the only word that can come to my mind... Seeing the view of Earth is so life-changing but also the boost the rocket motor kicking in. The whole trip to space and back is just amazing, Bandla told the NBC News in an interview.
Bandla described the moment as emotional and said, ""I have been dreaming of going to space since I was young and literally it is a dream come true.""
 
""I have wanted to be an astronaut but I wasn't able to go in the traditional National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) role and I took a very unconventional way to go to space and I do believe that a lot of people are going to be able to experience this and that's why we are here,"" she added.

On being asked if this was just a joyride for rich people, she said, ""As Virgin Galactic builds up...this is VSS Unity's ride to space today but we have got two more spaceships in the manufacture and we hope the cost would come down.""
Virgin Galactic  — the business Branson started in 2004  — aims to fly private citizens to the edge of space. The trips are designed to permit passengers to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and observe the curvature of Earth.
The Virgin Galactic carrier can launch up to eight people (two pilots and six passengers) on the Unity 22 flight, but on Sunday there were only six occupants (two pilots and four passengers).
 
The four mission specialists evaluated different experiences that Virgin Galactic has promised its future customers, many of whom have already reserved trips to space with the company at USD 250,000 a seat.

"As the first Indian female newsreader and radio jockey, Saeeda Bano left behind a pioneering legacy. Shahana Raza, her granddaughter who translated her memoir, Off the Beaten Track, remembers her as an emotionally resilient person in a chat with Sucheta Dasgupta
Aside from being an Indian radio pioneer, who broke bread with India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, your grandmother was one of India’s first independent Muslim women. Not only was she living by herself in the 1940s, in the 1930s, she drove a car unchaperoned. This is a freedom not available to most Indian women, Hindu or Muslim, even today. Did Saeeda Bano consider herself a feminist?
 
Did Saeeda Bano consider herself a feminist? I don’t know that for sure, but she most definitely knew she was ahead of her times, that the life she led was Dagar se Hatt kar, off the beaten track, which is why she used it as the title of her autobiography.
Your grandmother was more sporting than studious. She was not, in that sense, the typical intellectual feminist. Would you consider her a rebel in her household? How well was she loved by her family?
Relatively speaking, compared with her older siblings, Saeeda Bano was definitely the rebel in her family. The fact that she was allowed to be herself, especially by her father, went a long way in filling her with confidence and also proves they loved her for who she was.
 
In the book, she refers to herself as a girl with “a strange blend of complicated traits in her personality'. Yes, she was more sporting than studious, but she also read voraciously. After marriage she receives both love and importance from her husband’s family as well, especially from her father-in-law Justice Mohammed Raza.
What, to your mind, did she have to give up in order to lead the life that she did and accomplish what she did?
In order to achieve what she did, Saeeda Bano had to, first and foremost, give up the emotional comfort and the financial security that comes with being part of a loving joint family. Embracing uncertainties, she forsook the familiarity and convenience of living in an easygoing city like Lucknow and went off to Delhi at the time of Partition in August 1947, tackling courageously the various challenges that came her way during this crucial time in history. To lead her life according to the dictates of her own conscience, she schooled her heart to face social disapproval.
 
One of the most charming episodes in the book is to do with Saeeda’s friendship with the singer and courtesan, Begum Akhtar. This friendship was forged despite the then prevailing custom of women observing purdah from courtesans. Surprisingly, her interactions with Akhtari met with little resistance at her in-laws’ and she managed to create from them a family tie. Was her husband’s family relatively liberal or was it due to her personal charisma that this became possible?
Bit of both, I would say. Initially, there was some feeble, lukewarm  resistance from her family. Ultimately she managed to persuade her husband Abbas Raza to visit Akhtari Bai’s kotha.
 
Was it Saeeda who broke the ice between lawyer Ishtiaq Abbasi’s acquaintances and Akhtari, thus clearing the path for their eventual marriage?
I don’t think Saeeda Bano had much to do with breaking the ice between Ishtiaq Abbasi’s acquaintances and Akhtari Bai. But after Akhtari approached my grandmother at the radio station and said, “Bittan, please get me married to Ishtiaq Abbasi sahab,” she took the bull by the horns. In her inimitably bold style, she called Ishtiaq bhai over for tea and candidly asked him to marry Akhtari! The rest, as they say, is history.
 
There is a documentary on Begum Akhtar called Hai Akhtari, on YouTube for which director Kalidas Swaminathan interviewed my grandmother. In that, you can hear Saeeda Bano narrate this entire incident in the most delightful manner, exactly as it is written up in this book.
While reading the book, I noticed that when Saeeda examines the relationship of her lover, three-time Delhi mayor Nuruddin Ahmed, with his English first wife, Billy, she concludes that it had faced challenges due to Billy’s not belonging to his own culture of compliant, coquettish or circumspect, women. But she herself was neither of those. Why this inconsistency?
 
Since I never had the opportunity to see my grandmother with Nuruddin Ahmed sahab, I can’t say what she was like with him as a woman. Perhaps she was coquettish and felt vulnerable around him. People do have various sides to their personality. How we interact with our children is not what we are like with our spouse or our parents. Even headstrong forthright women can be submissive when they choose to be!
What is your earliest memory of your grandmother?
My earliest memory of my grandmother is when we came from Lucknow to Delhi during our school vacations to visit her. We would meet up with our uncles, aunts and cousins and spend a lot of time eating all sorts of delicious foodstuff at India International Centre and go on these enjoyable family picnics to Lodhi Garden. She loved picnics! I also remember her cook Shakur Baba vividly.
 
What has been your own career trajectory? Why do you think she chose you to translate her book?
Over the years, I’ve had to transform myself professionally into several avatars. After starting out as a VT editor for programmes and documentaries, I moved to news editing, then reporting, before I finally settled down as video producer and freelance writer. 
Around the time she asked me to translate her book we had grown quite close, without really realising it. We had managed, by default, to forge a strong one-on-one bond and learnt to accept the not-so-palatable sides of our personalities as well. If she ticked me off, I couldn’t go running to any parent. I was living alone and working in Delhi. If I triggered her off, there was really no one she could complain to about my behaviour. With no other adult to help us navigate our relationship with one another, we grew closer.
 
What, according to you, is the strength of this book?
The appeal of the book, in my opinion lies in the brutal honesty with which she visits the past, confronts her own experiences and decides, even when she comes face to face with a painful raw emotion, that yes, I want to speak about this. She could have chosen to leave some hurtful incidents out of the book. But she doesn’t. As I mentioned in the translator’s note, Simone de Beauvoir said in Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter, “The writer is a traitor to his despair as soon as he writes a book.”

"Hyderabad: Veteran Bollywood actor Dilip Kumar who breathed his last on Wednesday at the age of 98 had his share of bittersweet memories of Hyderabad. He married a Hyderabadi woman Asma Rahman sometime in 1980, though he was already married to Saira Banu. Dilip Kumar said a conspiracy was hatched that forced him to marry Asma Rahman.
Saira Banu was reportedly not aware of Dilip Kumar’s marriage with Asma. She came to know about it in 1982 when a tabloid made this sensational revelation. Though Saira Banu was pained to hear the news, she stood by Dilip Kumar when he had admitted his mistake and sought her time to undo the wrong through proper legal process and restore the sanctity of their marriage. Later Dilip Kumar divorced Asma.
 
Dilip Kumar had inaugurated the Owaisi Hospital & Research Centre managed by All India Majlis Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen in 1996. At a young age, Dilip Kumar used to visit Hyderabad. He had attended a few functions and wedding ceremonies held in Hyderabad. Dilip Kumar also contributed to the development of the Deccan Medical College.

Bit of both, I would say. Initially, there was some feeble, lukewarm  resistance from her family. Ultimately she managed to persuade her husband Abbas Raza to visit Akhtari Bai’s kotha.
 
Was it Saeeda who broke the ice between lawyer Ishtiaq Abbasi’s acquaintances and Akhtari, thus clearing the path for their eventual marriage?
I don’t think Saeeda Bano had much to do with breaking the ice between Ishtiaq Abbasi’s acquaintances and Akhtari Bai. But after Akhtari approached my grandmother at the radio station and said, “Bittan, please get me married to Ishtiaq Abbasi sahab,” she took the bull by the horns. In her inimitably bold style, she called Ishtiaq bhai over for tea and candidly asked him to marry Akhtari! The rest, as they say, is history.
 
There is a documentary on Begum Akhtar called Hai Akhtari, on YouTube for which director Kalidas Swaminathan interviewed my grandmother. In that, you can hear Saeeda Bano narrate this entire incident in the most delightful manner, exactly as it is written up in this book.
While reading the book, I noticed that when Saeeda examines the relationship of her lover, three-time Delhi mayor Nuruddin Ahmed, with his English first wife, Billy, she concludes that it had faced challenges due to Billy’s not belonging to his own culture of compliant, coquettish or circumspect, women. But she herself was neither of those. Why this inconsistency?
 
Since I never had the opportunity to see my grandmother with Nuruddin Ahmed sahab, I can’t say what she was like with him as a woman. Perhaps she was coquettish and felt vulnerable around him. People do have various sides to their personality. How we interact with our children is not what we are like with our spouse or our parents. Even headstrong forthright women can be submissive when they choose to be!
What is your earliest memory of your grandmother?
My earliest memory of my grandmother is when we came from Lucknow to Delhi during our school vacations to visit her. We would meet up with our uncles, aunts and cousins and spend a lot of time eating all sorts of delicious foodstuff at India International Centre and go on these enjoyable family picnics to Lodhi Garden. She loved picnics! I also remember her cook Shakur Baba vividly.
 
What has been your own career trajectory? Why do you think she chose you to translate her book?
Over the years, I’ve had to transform myself professionally into several avatars. After starting out as a VT editor for programmes and documentaries, I moved to news editing, then reporting, before I finally settled down as video producer and freelance writer. 
Around the time she asked me to translate her book we had grown quite close, without really realising it. We had managed, by default, to forge a strong one-on-one bond and learnt to accept the not-so-palatable sides of our personalities as well. If she ticked me off, I couldn’t go running to any parent. I was living alone and working in Delhi. If I triggered her off, there was really no one she could complain to about my behaviour. With no other adult to help us navigate our relationship with one another, we grew closer.
 
What, according to you, is the strength of this book?
The appeal of the book, in my opinion lies in the brutal honesty with which she visits the past, confronts her own experiences and decides, even when she comes face to face with a painful raw emotion, that yes, I want to speak about this. She could have chosen to leave some hurtful incidents out of the book. But she doesn’t. As I mentioned in the translator’s note, Simone de Beauvoir said in Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter, “The writer is a traitor to his despair as soon as he writes a book.”

"Love him or hate him, no one can ignore President Donald Trump or his efforts to stay in the limelight. Weeks after the US election results announced 290 Electoral College votes for former Vice-President Joe Biden, Trump still refuses to concede defeat.
Even as Michelle Obama, wife of former US President Barack Obama, took to her Instagram to slam President Trump for impeding the democratic process, while stating that the presidency doesn’t belong to any one individual or party, President Trump has been behaving like a child unwilling to give up his toy despite the end of recess. ‘Hidden’ away in the White House, Trump continues to sulk, inaccurately claiming on Twitter voter fraud and faulty vote counting, falsely proclaiming victory in a race he lost.
 
The ludicrous conduct so unbecoming of a leader of the oldest democracy. But the indignity he presently showcases is merely one of the many etiquette gaffs Trump has displayed on the world stage, be it nationally or internationally. While on the national podium he mocks not only his opponents but also the differently abled, internationally, he makes blunders that may even appear intentional. During his 2017 tour to Japan, for instance, Trump criticised Japan’s inaction on not bombing North Korean missiles, stating not too subtly that modern Japan was weak. Then there was a lunch, where unlike his predecessor Obama who when visiting the Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe in 2014 had dined with him over sushi, Trump chose to eat burgers made with American meat… er… in the sushi capital of the world!
 
Few guidelines on etiquette
1 Practise civility, professionalism and decorum in public forums.
A public servant, an elected representative or even a very senior leader in a company should avoid making belligerent, personal, impertinent and slanderous comments. They must never threaten or abuse.
Example: Who better than Trump himself for an example? He constantly mocked Democratic Party’s presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren for claiming Native American ancestry (for which she apologised later), calling her ‘Pocahontas’. Many of his office bearers took it as a green signal to mock others, including Vice-President-Elect Kamala Harris, by calling her Kamalama, Kalamala, Camel Harris, etc.
 
2 Avoid personal comments | Remember that public personalities are always on display, and whether they like it or not, their actions, mannerism and language are constantly watched by people they may or may not know.
Example: In July this year, reporters claimed to have overheard US Congressman and Republican Ted Yoho, who’d accosted NY City Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), the youngest Democrat in the chamber, on the steps of the US Capitol in July this year, calling her ‘disgusting’, saying ‘you’re out of your freaking mind’, and then using an extreme swear word, calling the latter a ‘b**ch’. (Of course, AOC called out the behaviour in the House floor, to let him and others know that such a language was not acceptable.)
 
3 Honour dignity | As per Donna Hicks, PhD, and author of Leading with Dignity, leaders play a crucial role in creating a culture that brings out the best in people and must know how to honour the dignity of their people while creating policies that are sensitive to dignity issues. And to make dignity and dignity awareness a part of the workplace or social culture, the leader needs to model dignified behaviours. So if a president of a nation appears to not accept the verdict of its people nor honour the dignity of his position, the trickle-down effect could be a chaotic society refusing to accept rules and regulations laid down for it.

"Hyderabad: The city’s air is rife with Nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This is contrary to popular belief that the lockdown has helped improve the air quality, an analysis conducted by Greenpeace India Society has found.
Nitrogen dioxide pollution is known to cause damage to the human respiratory tract, cause asthma and make a person vulnerable to other respiratory infections. The study said there was growing evidence that polluted cities suffered disproportionately more from coronavirus cases.
 
Increased concentrations of NO2, Greenpeace said, were found not just in Hyderabad but across several cities in India during the current Covid19 pandemic.
The report published on Wednesday said: “In Hyderabad, nitrogen dioxide air pollution was 69 per cent higher in April 2021 than in the same month the previous year. A part of this difference is attributable to changing weather conditions. After removing the effect of weather, there is still an increase of 38 per cent which is attributed to an increase in emissions.”
After a year since the initial Covid lockdown went into effect, NO2 pollution has increased in eight Indian cities -- Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Lucknow.
 
According to satellite observations, NO2 pollution in Hyderabad increased by 69 per cent between April 2020 and April 2021. The weather had only a little of the contribution to this change. In Delhi, NO2 was higher by 125 per cent, Chennai by 94 per cent Mumbai by 52 per cent, Bengaluru by 90 per cent Kolkata by 11 per cent, Jaipur by 47 per cent and Lucknow by 32 per cent in April 2021 than in the same month the previous year
While there was an opinion that the weather conditions would abate the pollution, the result drawn out in the study showed that despite taking the weather conditions into account,  NO2 pollution occurred. This was primarily due to changes in emissions, while weather influence was only of secondary importance in most places,” it said.
 
According to Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner with Greenpeace India, “The air quality levels in these cities are alarming. People saw clean skies and breathed fresh air during the nationwide lockdown though it was an unintended consequence of the pandemic. The disruption caused by the pandemic is a case for transition to cleaner, equitable and sustainable decentralised energy sources such as rooftop solar and clean and sustainable mobility. The recovery from the pandemic must not come at the expense of a return to previous levels of air pollution.”

"It’s quite the no-brainer. The lexicographer’s choice of the year at first appearance was gratuitous, but on closer examination drove home the understanding that plague and Spanish flu notwithstanding, in terms of scope and impact, Covid-19 was the world’s first real “pandemic” which simultaneously gave us a taste of the awful homogeneity technology and globalisation has reduced us to, in a reckoning of sorts.
But that is what the word of the year, or woty, as it is acronymed, and pronounceably so, does; be it lived reality or a culture war, it captures the spirit of the times. For instance, last year’s winner was “they”, as used to describe a transgender person, someone who does not identify as male nor female, as compared with or, if you like, opposed to the (cis)gender-neutral pronoun in the singular number, itself interred in 2017 in the Chicago Manual of Style.
 
No doubt, though, “pandemic”, voted in by Merriem-Webster and Dictionary.com as Oxford indulged in some good old fence-sitting by picking not one or two but 16 appellations, had good competition. It mainly came from medical lingo like “asymptomatic”, “contact tracing”, “lockdown” and, of course, “quarantine”, as well as neologisms, often at once political and “viral”, such as “anti-masker”, “the Before Times”, “BLM”, “Antifa” and “Zoom fatigue”, also “Karen” denoting a middle-class white American woman prone to bullying black men in a convenient and self-serving interpretation of women’s rights. But good old “pandemic” — the word first was used in the mid-1600s in the sense of “universal” or “affecting everyone” and began appearing in medical texts concerning the plague soon after — won the vocabulary sweepstakes, “cancelling” them all.
 
Now all this hooha over una palabra might infuriate some of us who like to look down on intellectual gifts and make a song and dance about “deed over word”. We know who they are but we choose here not to name them.

"Thiruvananthapuram: Tourists coming to Kerala will now be able to savour delicious local cuisine while sitting in the comfort of their cars as the state Tourism Department launched in-car dining to boost tourism and also to meet the challenges of COVID-19.
The restaurants run by Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) across the state will cater to tourists with in-car dining.
 
To know how it feels like dining in a car, Kerala Tourism Minister PA Mohammed Riyas himself had his favourite dishes sitting inside his car.
""The in-car dining is a project designed to give a boost to Kerala tourism sector hit badly by COVID-19. To revive we are launching this project by which tourists coming to Kerala will be able to use this service. Amid COVID-19 pandemic, instead of dining inside a restaurant and mingling with the crowd, such a project will also ensure safety,"" said Riyas.
Kayamkulam MLA U Pratibha also joined the minister during the launch of the project.
 
This venture comes at a time when tourism, which is a mainstay of Kerala that contributes to 11 per cent to state SDP, incurred loss due to COVID-19.
To overcome the crisis, the Kerala government also has mooted the idea of complete vaccinated tourism and also to find new tourism destinations.
The Tourism Minister said the state has initiated a project in which a new destination will be identified in every Panchayat. There are also projects in the pipeline to develop new heritage and pilgrim tourism destinations to attract maximum domestic travellers.

"A future world war might as well be started with a seed capital of $100,000 or less. That is the sobering reality of the Twitter security breach incident compromising a swathe of prominent people, from former US President Barack Obama to Elon Musk.
In a matter of hours, Twitter had shut down most of its verified Twitter handles and launched an active investigation into the breach.
 
A seed capital of $100,000 or less can be used to do widespread harm by hacking into social media sites that seem innocuous but are now vehicles of a new kind of warfare.
On April 23, 2013, the world saw what a Twitter hacking can do. The official Twitter handle of Associated Press tweeted a breaking story -- “Two explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured”. The tweet came at 1.07 pm and AP’s two million followers on Twitter started retweeting the issue in a matter of seconds.
In his book Future Crimes, author and former policeman Marc Goodman estimated that in just three minutes, that tweet had wiped out $136 billion from the stock markets.
 
A little-known hacking group, Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), admitted it had hacked into AP’s official Twitter handle. The SEA caused massive economic damage without even spending any major resources, and it did not even target a US official website or system.
Just the hack into the Twitter handle of a major private news organisation was enough to cause significant damage.
This is how social media has emerged as a tool of modern warfare, It is free to access, has vast reach, consumes very little resources, and makes the world a target. The current Twitter hacking raises two major obvious issues.
 
One, the social media has to be seen from the lens of national security and the threats they pose. Second, India needs to revisit some of its regulations around the social media and bring them up to date with current realities.
While it is not clear whether the current hack into Twitter was done through social engineering or by paying off Twitter employees, it brings forth another question: how did the hackers know who in the social media corporation had access to these internal tools?
It even managed to reset emails as well as bypass two-factor authentication, even for high-profile accounts including a US presidential candidate and targeted them precisely to achieve their goals.
 
The compromised insider is not a first for the social media. In 2017 a Twitter employee temporarily deactivated the US President’s Twitter account and two Twitter employees spied on activists for the Saudi government.
Both these incidents show the power that site reliability engineers (SREs) hold inside the tech company, and how they can be targeted by simply looking at SRE Meetups held in Meetup.com, an online service that hosts regular meetups.
It is then a matter of time to recruit one of them to spy on a critic that a nation state dislikes, or to convince them to give access to internal tools to post a message declaring war on another state, using the head of state’s Twitter account.
 
As the US Navy Chief of Naval Operations put it so eloquently, “social media literacy is national security too”. It is possible that after this incident, this statement has to be retold as “social media SRE is national security too”.
Closer home, in December 2016 Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and many colleagues found their Twitter handles compromised.
According to Indian government sources, this was done by hackers who managed to get domain-level access to the Indian National Congress’ emails, leading to a cascade of hacks including their Twitter handles.
 
No FIRs were filed, and few paid attention to the national security threat such a hack poses.
What if the hack was done by an inimical power to create political chaos in India?
In the polarised political climate that engulfs India, such a creative use of a Twitter hack is very much within the realm of possibility.
Indians still don’t know what happened to Facebook when their data was found to be compromised by Cambridge Analytica.
And the US intelligence community is convinced the Russians successfully used Facebook to influence the 2016 US elections, propelling Donald Trump to an unexpected victory.
 
An unforeseen side effect of this incident would also be a relook on the safe harbour protections that social media companies enjoy. In India the Supreme Court’s Shreya Singhal ruling allows social media companies to indemnify themselves against any risk posed by content posted by one of their users.
The latest Twitter hack raises difficult questions for India and its safe harbour protections for social media companies.
If a single compromised employee can hijack a former US President or a presidential candidate’s account and post messages on bitcoins, does it not imply that the social media platform is no longer an intermediary and now has the power to create content?
 
Accepting that will be a paradigm shift for India’s regulatory landscape for big tech and especially social media companies.
Would we also eventually end up in a situation where SREs with access to sensitive accounts will need a security clearance from the intelligence arm of nation states to avoid an enemy state hijacking the head of state’s account?
It is quite possible it might, and therein lies the significance of this incident. Social media platforms’ internal processes, systems and their engineers might be subjected to public scrutiny in the same way as that of critical infrastructure systems like nuclear plants, power grids and major transport systems.

"New Delhi: “Matrimonial ad by a feminist” is an oxymoron. These advertisements are often sexist and casteist, putting emphasis on attributes like caste, class, height, and the colour of one’s skin, and using salary and other wealth related attributes to appeal to potential matrimonial partners.
However, a matrimonial advertisement “by a feminist” went viral after comedian Aditi Mittal tweeted about it, bringing the advertisement into the limelight.
 
The advertisement read: “Match for opinionated feminist. 30+ educated girl, short hair, piercings, works in the social sector against capitalism. Wanted handsome, well-built, strictly 25-28 years old only son with established business, bungalow/at least 20 acre farmhouse. Should know cooking. No farters/burpers please. Write to curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com.”
The advertisement, obviously fake, was a prank to emphasise the sexist and misogynistic ideology behind matrimonial advertisements. The owners of the email curbyourpatriarchy@gmail.com- under the pseudonyms Sakshi, her brother Srijan and her best friend Damyanti- told BBC that it was a prank played on Sakshi for her 30th birthday.
 
""Turning 30 is a milestone, especially because of all the conversation in our society around marriage. As you turn 30, your family and society start putting pressure on you to get married and settle down,"" Srijan said.
However, once the advertisement went viral, it reopened the debate of the sexism and misogyny of matrimonial ads. Though she did receive many positive emails, Sakshi claimed that there were a plethora of hate emails sent her way as the ad hurt a lot of fragile egos, ranging from feminism-bashers to trolls sending death threats over a prank.
 
""You can't say such things out loud. Men ask for tall, slim beautiful brides all the time, they brag about their wealth, but when the tables are turned, they can't stomach it. How could a woman set such criteria?"" She added, ""[The ad] was a satirical statement on this narrative and I assume that the people getting triggered are the same as those who put out these kinds of 'slim, fair, beautiful bride wanted' type of ads in the first place"".
And for those upset by an obvious prank, she asks: ""Do you send such triggered emails to all the sexist, casteist 'bride wanted' adverts that appear in the papers everyday? If not, then you need to curb your patriarchy"".

"Even as more and more tests are done in India, a trend involving the well-educated and elite opened a risky can of worms.
Various news reports talk about a wealthy someone throwing a marriage or birthday party, inviting several people to it while putting them all at risk.
 
By not adhering to safety precautions they are, inadvertently, helping in the community spread of the virus.
In her Medium article, ‘Why India’s “Elite” is the Hidden Threat of COVID-19’, writer Shubbu Amin effectively talks about the callousness of the elite class through multiple examples of how they speak about ‘Life has to go on’, ‘Oh, but we’re all fine; we won’t get it’ and ‘We are bored sitting at home’. She adds that while only a hand few can exercise those ‘privileges’, their ‘complaints’ not only apply to partying and socialising in person but also put everyone around them at risk so.
 
COVID-19, the great leveller
Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, Hon State Secretary, Indian Medical Association, Telangana State, is certain it is not time yet to celebrate. Instead, he sheds light on how some among the elite believe nothing could happen to them. “Everybody is equal in the eyes of coronavirus. It won’t stop from infecting you just because you are wealthy,” says Dr Sanjeev.
“Often, people think that money and power will get them everywhere, but now that’s not the case with coronavirus.” Then talking about the number of people he has witnessed placing emergency services car stickers so that they can move around freely, he adds how many even tend to ‘forget’ that they still need to wear a mask while they are comfortably sitting inside their AC cars. “It is the air from outside that the cooling system is venting out, which may carry the virus,” he adds, warning, “People need to understand that for the poor and the working class venturing out for work is a need, whereas for the elite class, visiting a coffee shop or a restaurant is a choice. The coming one month is a crucial time for all in India.”
 
Social distancing still the best option
Dr Viswesvaran Balasubramanian, Senior Interventional Pulmonologist and Sleep Medicine Specialist, Yashoda Hospitals, agrees to the importance of social distancing and how easy it is for the coronavirus to spread in the community.
“Spreading of coronavirus among people is very easy even if you are very careful,” he cautions. “That one sharing of a smoke or drink is enough. Social distancing is the best option to contain the numbers and to ensure you do not risk your near and dear ones.”
 
Pointing out how in the US, someone had organised a Corona Party recently, just for the sake of it, which ended in a couple of the guests dying too, he warns that homes can be a huge source of infection too. “Interestingly, the highest chance of contracting the virus is when there is a social gathering at home or for businessmen when meeting many people regularly.”
Behave responsibly
Dr Nikhil Mathur, Vice President Medical Services CARE Group of Hospitals, also believes that community spread is inevitable especially if people with higher income don’t behave responsibly.
 
“Till an effective vaccine is found and distributed, the use of mask and sanitisers while maintaining social distance should be enforced,” says Dr NIkhil. “There is no point in unnecessarily increasing one’s risk of contracting the virus by visiting a public place. With news coming in that the virus can be airborne and that people can be asymptomatic, even if you remove the mask for a few seconds to have a sip from your soft drink while enjoying with friends at a mall, you are still at risk.”
Then, the doctor talks about how once a person is infected with the virus, they are at risk of infecting many others, some of whom may even not have the means to get treatment.
 
“Elite or not, people are still fighting against the social stigma of being a coronavirus patient. It is important to encourage people to come out if they are not feeling well and report to their authorities and get proper medical help. Also, employers among the elite class need to stop looking beyond their profits and look after their employees in need and not cut salaries if they are not being able to attend work due to illness,” says Dr Nikhil adding, how it is a collective responsibility of all to safeguard themselves.

"Even as more and more tests are done in India, a trend involving the well-educated and elite opened a risky can of worms.
Various news reports talk about a wealthy someone throwing a marriage or birthday party, inviting several people to it while putting them all at risk.
 
By not adhering to safety precautions they are, inadvertently, helping in the community spread of the virus.
In her Medium article, ‘Why India’s “Elite” is the Hidden Threat of COVID-19’, writer Shubbu Amin effectively talks about the callousness of the elite class through multiple examples of how they speak about ‘Life has to go on’, ‘Oh, but we’re all fine; we won’t get it’ and ‘We are bored sitting at home’. She adds that while only a hand few can exercise those ‘privileges’, their ‘complaints’ not only apply to partying and socialising in person but also put everyone around them at risk so.
 
COVID-19, the great leveller
Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, Hon State Secretary, Indian Medical Association, Telangana State, is certain it is not time yet to celebrate. Instead, he sheds light on how some among the elite believe nothing could happen to them. “Everybody is equal in the eyes of coronavirus. It won’t stop from infecting you just because you are wealthy,” says Dr Sanjeev.
“Often, people think that money and power will get them everywhere, but now that’s not the case with coronavirus.” Then talking about the number of people he has witnessed placing emergency services car stickers so that they can move around freely, he adds how many even tend to ‘forget’ that they still need to wear a mask while they are comfortably sitting inside their AC cars. “It is the air from outside that the cooling system is venting out, which may carry the virus,” he adds, warning, “People need to understand that for the poor and the working class venturing out for work is a need, whereas for the elite class, visiting a coffee shop or a restaurant is a choice. The coming one month is a crucial time for all in India.”
 
Social distancing still the best option
Dr Viswesvaran Balasubramanian, Senior Interventional Pulmonologist and Sleep Medicine Specialist, Yashoda Hospitals, agrees to the importance of social distancing and how easy it is for the coronavirus to spread in the community.
“Spreading of coronavirus among people is very easy even if you are very careful,” he cautions. “That one sharing of a smoke or drink is enough. Social distancing is the best option to contain the numbers and to ensure you do not risk your near and dear ones.”
 
Pointing out how in the US, someone had organised a Corona Party recently, just for the sake of it, which ended in a couple of the guests dying too, he warns that homes can be a huge source of infection too. “Interestingly, the highest chance of contracting the virus is when there is a social gathering at home or for businessmen when meeting many people regularly.”
Behave responsibly
Dr Nikhil Mathur, Vice President Medical Services CARE Group of Hospitals, also believes that community spread is inevitable especially if people with higher income don’t behave responsibly.
 
“Till an effective vaccine is found and distributed, the use of mask and sanitisers while maintaining social distance should be enforced,” says Dr NIkhil. “There is no point in unnecessarily increasing one’s risk of contracting the virus by visiting a public place. With news coming in that the virus can be airborne and that people can be asymptomatic, even if you remove the mask for a few seconds to have a sip from your soft drink while enjoying with friends at a mall, you are still at risk.”

"Hyderabad: It was a chance discovery, says Dr Kumar Eswaran, a mathematical physicist in the city, who claims to have found the solution to the Riemann Hypothesis, a millennium problem in mathematics. It was waiting for proof for 161 years, Dr Eswaran told this newspaper.
The Riemann Hypothesis, touted to be number one out of the top 10 unsolved mathematical problems, was designated as a millennium problem in 2000, with a reward of $1 million from Clay Mathematics Institute, Oxford, England, for anyone who could solve it.
 
""It was, in fact, back in 2016, that I first gave proof for the formula improved by the great mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann in the 1800s. I had put it on the web for open review and downloads after working on it for about six weeks. During 2018-19, I gave several lectures on the proof,” Dr Eswaran, 74, who is with the Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Hyderabad, said.
The Riemann Hypothesis, in the simplest possible explanation, relates to how prime numbers are distributed. This has been a problem that has challenged mathematicians for generations. According to mathematicians who have grappled with the hypothesis, proof of the Riemann Hypothesis would have far-reaching consequences for number theory and for the use of primes in cryptography, and would automatically lead to the proof of numerous theorems which are dependent on the truth of this hypothesis.
 
In Dr Eswaran's methodology, the ‘factorisation sequence of numbers’ was shown to be like a 'random walk', he said. ""This method used was actually not just number theories. I had to use techniques from random variables and probability as well,"" Dr Eswaran added.  
An expert committee of scientists including Dr T. Ramasami, former secretary, Union ministry of science and technology, Prof. P. Narasimha Reddy, executive director, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Prof. M. Seetharaman, former professor and Chair, department of theoretical physics, University of Madras, Prof. V. Srinivasan, former professor and dean, School of Physics, UoH, Prof. K. Srinivasa Rao, former senior professor, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, Prof. M. D. Srinivas, senior Fellow, Centre for Policy Studies, Prof. Vinayak Eswaran, department of mechanical and aerospace engineering, IIT Hyderabad, and Dr Adindla Suma, associate professor, department of computer science, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology conducted an open review of the proof for a year from February 2020 to conclude that Dr Eswaran had indeed proved the Riemann Hypothesis.  
 
The committee invited more than 1,200 mathematicians to participate in an open review of the presented proof. The review was open in the sense that the referees had to be willing to have their names and institutional affiliations openly revealed, so that nothing is done anonymously, and nothing can be said that would not be openly available for all other experts to see.
Dr Eswaran said in his experience this had been the most fair and robust way to get the proposed proof assessed. The expert committee then examined the comments of the reviewers and the responses of the author. In their final meeting held on May 16, the committee concluded that Dr Eswaran’s proof of the Riemann Hypothesis is correct.
 
The committee also ruled that the proof, the referees’ comments, and the author’s responses in their entirety, without any redactions, should be published in the form of an e-book and made available to the public at large and then followed, a few months later, by a hard copy.

"How Pilot crashed
The sordid bid to topple the Rajasthan government has exposed the worst in both the Congress party and the BJP.
 
Going by the confessions, the inspired leaks and the whispers, it is clear that chief minister Ashok Gehlot has not been on talking terms with his deputy, Sachin Pilot, since December 2018.
But Gehlot apparently had a line of communication with the former maharani of Dholpur and princess of Gwalior, Vasundhara Raje Scindia.
Sources in both the BJP and the Congress reveal that Gehlot was a step ahead of Pilot simply because someone from Vasundhara Raje's side was tipping him off about Pilot’s moves. Gehlot, a former magician, kept gathering information and piling up a dossier that read like a charge-sheet. The crafty Gehlot did not rush to Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi with this dossier.
 
A chartered plane was reportedly sent to Thiruvananthapuram to fetch AICC general secretary K.C. Venugopal, a favourite of Rahul; he, in turn, handed over the explosive material to the Gandhis.
The Gandhis are now in a dilemma. Their stated position of opposing anyone having truck with the BJP is compromised as both Gehlot and Pilot were reportedly in touch with the enemy.
Corona protocol
Covid-19 has changed a lot in Lutyens’ Delhi. In the Raksha Rajya Mantri’s office for instance, defence ministry personnel are not encouraged to visit unless they are summoned.
 
The informal list of do’s and don’ts at Dr Subhash Bhamre’s office also demands that officers remain seated each time the minister walks in or out.
Baluni fortunate
Union urban development and civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri made a smart move by allocating Priyanka Gandhi’s bungalow — 35, Lodhi Estate, New Delhi — to Amit Shah’s right-hand man Anil Baluni, who also heads the BJP’s media department.
Baluni is recovering from cancer so the sympathy factor also came into play. Puri’s statement that Priyanka tried seeking an extension was quickly denied by the AICC general secretary but it may have a grain of truth.
 
Apparently, without Priyanka’s knowledge or consent, Anand Sharma or K.T.S. Tulsi are suspected to have spoken to Puri even while Priyanka was all set to move out of Lodhi Estate.
Who broke quarantine
Covid-19 continues to bother the political class. At a recently held meeting of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, a senior official sat close to Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, the Congress party leader in the Lok Sabha.
The additional secretary rank babu tested positive for the coronavirus. Everyone, including Chaudhary, had to while away time in home quarantine — other than a BJP notable who is said to have ignored the advice.
 
Sun shines for PR
While the Ashok Gehlot-Sachin Pilot tussle has stressed out a section of the Congress party, some public relations companies are gloating. A prominent Delhi-based PR person, known to have near-perfect relations with many politicians, quickly grabbed Gehlot’s account.
Every morning, scribes and talking heads on TV covering the Rajasthan slugfest have been getting a healthy dose of talking points on WhatsApp. Pilot’s side is not sitting idle. Last heard, Pilot, an accomplished pistol shooter, has engaged some fine PR personalities. They are not missing the target either.

"ANANTAPUR: Lack of rains yet in parts of Rayalaseema has led to rural people enacting the centuries-old tradition of protesting against the Rain God with “Karuvu Rallu” or drought stones.
As per the tradition, villagers in this drought-prone region throw waste material of their village, including the drought stones, on outskirts of another village to appease the Rain God into showering rains. Villagers, however, exercise caution while throwing the drought stones, lest it lead to a clash with members of the targeted village.
 
All such stones are finally dumped into Penna and other rivers of Rayalaseema bordering Karnataka. Senior citizens say this tradition has been continuing even to this day, as the practise not only appeases the Rain God but also checks farmers from falling into depression due to their inability in raising crops.
This Deccan Chronicle reporter saw a dump of drought stones on outskirts of Seebai village in Kalyanadurgam mandal of Anantapur district. They must have been dumped there by inmates of one of the villages trying to appease the Rain God.
 
Rajanna from Kalayandurgam area said this tradition has been a part of Rayalaseema farmers’ life for many centuries. Karuvu Rallu on outskirts of another village are seen as a positive sign.
Dr. Harinath Reddy of Rayalaseema Vedika says this tradition of protest is mostly seen in villages around Goddess Gangamma temples, which are constructed mostly close to river beds and irrigation tanks. “At these temples, villagers seeking rains offer traditional poojas and ululate to express their grief at lack of rains”, Dr Reddy explained.
 
According to reports available, many areas of Rayalaseema have experienced 72 drought years in the past 145 years. Such high variability in southwest monsoon is an indicator of the risk associated with farming in this district. It has 7 lakh hectares of dry land whose cultivators depend only on seasonal rains.

"The net worth of Kiran Mazumdar Shaw in 2020 is $420 crore. But that is not the only reason why the executive chairperson of Biocon evokes admiration amongst her contemporaries.
Kiran has also been conferred with the prestigious IMC Ladies’ Wing —Woman of the Year Award 2019–2020.
 
Vanita Bhandari, the president of the organisation, pays her tribute by saying, “Ms Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw is a shining light who has broken the glass ceiling and paved a successful path in the fields of science and chemistry. Her vision, talent, dedication and philanthropic initiatives motivate us to aspire high.”
Excerpts from the conversation with Ms Shaw:
Now that Biocon’s ‘original’ drug Itolizumab has finally got the much-needed approval, what is your current state of mind?
It is a truly innovative, original drug, which is made in India. We have not copied any other drug. I don’t think anybody has picked this important factor, which is what makes it disappointing.
 
It is life-saving. This is not a small feat. When the disease gets to a serious stage, nothing can help you except drugs like ours. Itolizumab regulates all cytokines in that pathway.
This is a first drug from India that will stand on its own. Why can’t people be proud of a drug made in India? We believed in this drug for the last 20 years. So, it’s a fantastic feeling now.
Many Indian companies are rushing to claim they can make the vaccine available by September/ October, when experts say it’s not possible till next year. Your comments?
 
You can make a vaccine by this period, but the question is if you can deliver a well-validated vaccine. It is like the Russians claiming they have developed the vaccine, which is fine as anyone can make a vaccine.
Today, if Astra Zeneca develops the vaccine, they also have to evaluate it. You have to do this to check whether there is a possibility of being re-infected by the virus.
Secondly, even if you have responded positively to the vaccine, you need to know for how long you are going to be protected. Realistically, you could get a vaccine by the end of this year, but it is vital to check the safety and reliability factor before even I would use it.
 
The ongoing pandemic has changed everyone’s life. What has your learning been from this situation?
It is definitely something to worry about; it is a serious disease and people have still not understood the gravity of the disease.
But it is not necessary that you are going to die. The people who have to worry about COVID-19 are the vulnerable population. I should be worried; I am over 60 but since I don’t have co-morbidities, I am not worried so much about myself, but I have to remain safe as my mom is almost 90 and my husband is 70 and they are both cancer survivors.
 
You are very vocal with your views on social media and otherwise. Are you not worried about anti reactions?
If you are honest and if you have no mal-intent and there is no agenda, nothing will happen. If I have political aspirations, then maybe it will have an impact.
You put a succession plan in place several years back. At a time when the nepotism debate is ongoing, what made you opt for such a radical (at that time) decision?
 I don’t agree with this nepotism debate because if a person is good you must give an opportunity to him/her but you should not give it just because they are your family.
 
For instance, Azim Premji’s son Rishad is a capable youngster who understands the business at Wipro though they have an outside guy at the helm. My niece — a brilliant cancer immunologist, PhD, MBA from Stanford, Masters from MIT — worked at Third Rock Ventures in the US.
I told her to do something for Biocon. I started a small biotech company in Boston and have asked her to run it. But she is the kind of person who has earned it. As far as Biocon biologics is concerned, I don’t think she can run this.
This is a very professional business and so it is helmed by professionals.
You have a strong, admirable relationship with your husband. What is the secret?
 
I just think it is your commitment to anything. First, you have to make a judgement call about the person and then obviously you will have some differences and arguments, all of which happen in a marriage.
But at the same time, it is a commitment you made. For me, my husband has played a very important role in my life. He has really supported me in a fantastic way.
Not many husbands would be happy to support their wives to be at the front. He has always taken the backseat. He always tells me, ‘It is your business... you have to run it and I will support you but you need to lead it.’ That’s a fantastic quality. We have respect for each other.
 
You are a fiercely loyal friend who has stood by Vijay Mallya through all the tough times.
I am just a good, loyal friend, and there are lots of people who are good friends too. In fact, I would often point out to Vijay to see how many of all his fair-weather friends would be with him when the chips are down. I was right. He agrees with me now. I was the only one who would caution him then, but he would never listen to me.

"Hyderabad: Milkha Singh made waves at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, but his baby steps as a sprinter were taken here in Secunderabad, where he was recruited in the Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (EME) of the Army back in 1952.
The ’Flying Sikh’ died of Covid complications late on Saturday night. He was 91.
 
He trained in and around the EME Centre area, building his strength and stamina by taking up many an uphill task — he would run up the Ammuguda hill carrying a stone-filled bag and also run alongside a train, which ran on the then metre gauge track between Bolaram and Ammuguda. “The driver of a particular train used to encourage and egg me on. It was kind of a motivation and I could run for a longer distance,” Milkha recalled in interviews later.
He has always credited the Army, EME and Secunderabad Cantonment for his sporting success. “Had I not joined the Army I would not have worked so hard,” Milkha said.
 
Fittingly, a colony in the EME Centre is named after him, as also the Stadium inside the EME Centre where he trained. While inaugurating the Milkha Singh Stadium in 2014, the legend had got emotional, kissed the turf and said it was like a gurudwara to him.
Secunderabad, where Milkha lived from 1952 to 1960 and prepared for the 1960 Olympics at which he missed the 400 metres bronze medal by a whisker, was always special to him. “Whenever he came across athletes from Secunderabad/ Hyderabad, he would develop an instant affinity. ‘Mai Secunderabad ka rice khaney ke baad running start kiya’ (I have started running after eating rice in Secunderabad) he once told me in jest. He would also talk about his many memories here,” Prabhakara Rao Mulagala, veteran long-distance runner from the city, told this newspaper.
 
“We should also remember Milkha used to run on cinder tracks, not on the present synthetic ones that give athletes the advantage of up to a second. He was the first to run the 400m under 46 seconds, at a meet in Oslo (Norway) a fortnight or so before the Rome Olympics, where he was unfortunate to finish fourth, 0.1 second behind Malcolm Spence of South Africa. Later, South Africa was banned from sport for 36 years because of apartheid... that bronze could’ve belonged to Milkha, who competed against the world’s best,” added Prabhakara, who has won 300-plus gold medals at national and international races, and at 69 still competes in races.

"It’s amazing how medical technology has advanced. Half a century ago, for instance, cancer meant an almost certain death. Now, about a third of all cancer patients survive. Not all cancers yield readily to treatment, but there are new ways to detect cancer early, and to treat it successfully.
A little further back, in the early 20th century, pernicious anaemia meant almost certain death. Towards the mid-1920s, it became treatable. Its exact cause was discovered in the 1950s: a deficiency of vitamin B12. Treatment was simple, effective, and inexpensive.
 
There’ve been equally amazing advances in the treatment of diseases of the eye, for example. Sixty or seventy years ago, if you had a retinal detachment, the chances were that you’d go blind. Today, methods are so advanced that fixing a detachment is almost a matter of routine.
It’s not just technology: there are outstanding doctors who used some of these inventions to good effect. There’s Christiaan Barnard, for example, who did the first heart transplant back in the 1960s...
Doctors and technology have made huge differences to lives, but sometimes, in individual cases, there’s also the matter of luck, sometimes dumb luck. Let me give you an example.
 
It began in 1976, in Trivandrum, not long before my school exams. My parents were worried about the effect of all that swotting on my weak eyes: I’d used spectacles since I was 10, and the lenses got thicker every year. My parents thought that contact lenses would reduce the eyestrain, and decided that I deserved a pair, which was good news, because it meant a good excuse to bunk school.
The only place where you could check out contact lenses was the Government Ophthalmic  Hospital, which we knew very well, thanks to those weak eyes.
 
Dad and I went there one sunny morning, and bumped into a technician he knew. He told Dad to leave me with him and not to worry, so I found myself alone in the large, crowded waiting hall, with just enough money to get back home.
Soon a lady doctor turned up, led me to a small chamber furnished with benches, put some drops in my eyes. Some 15 minutes, she inserted lenses into my eyes, and told me to wait awhile. With the lenses in place, I could see rather better, and I enjoyed that for a while. But then, I’d been up half the night reading a new Alistair MacLean thriller, and the waiting was making me unbearably sleepy. Some minutes after the doctor left, I lay down on one of the benches and dozed off.
 
When I woke, the world was blurred again. I had no idea what had happened to the contact lenses. I thought they might have fallen off while I slept, so I spent the next few minutes on my hands and knees, feeling the entire dusty concrete floor for those fragile bits of glass, and despaired when I couldn’t find them.
When the doctor returned I told her I’d lost the lenses. Perhaps she was new: she wasn’t quite sure what to do so, she fetched help in the shape of an older lady doctor. This new doctor found the lenses at the sides of my eyes and retrieved them gently, all the while giving me a lecture on my irresponsible behaviour.
 
When the lenses were safely out, she relented, perhaps because of my nerdy looks, and offered me a bit of advice: if I studied regularly, she said, I wouldn’t have to lose sleep over exams. She saw my heavy spectacles, and continued, “Hmmm! Let me have a good look at your eyes.”
She led me to a dark room with instruments with glowing lights and many handles and levers. After a longish inspection, she shut off everything and led me back to the room with the benches. “You need some minor surgery in both eyes,” she said, “but we can’t do it here. You’ll have to go to Madras for it... It’s nothing very serious, but you have to get it done. Come back tomorrow with your father. Ask for me. My name is Mary Kuriakose.”
 
Next day, she spoke almost exclusively to Dad. “Your son’s retina has weak spots,” she said, “but we can strengthen those. One Dr Badrinath in Madras will do it.”
“He’s got his exams coming up,” Dad said. “Can it wait until after that?”
She smiled. “It’ll have to,” she said. “You’ll have to wait at least two months for your appointment.” She handed Dad a letter referring me to Dr Badrinath. “Write to him immediately.”
Dr Badrinath, was a large, reassuring man with an American accent. He took the time to explain the problem to me, and not just to Dad, and the procedure went off smoothly. One round of treatment wasn’t enough, and, over the next few years, it was repeated several times. Meanwhile, technology kept progressing.
By the 1990s, retinal detachments could be treated with a good chance of success, much better than in the late 1980s.
 
And so, when I had a retinal detachment last year, fixing it was a routine operation, something that wouldn’t have been possible a quarter of century ago.
Then, earlier this year, my friend Dr Kamath found that the cataract in the good eye needed to be removed, and did so late in June. As this goes to press, I’m still recovering from this round of surgery, and, with any luck, won’t need any more.
So, I’m grateful to dumb luck. If I hadn’t gone to sleep in that waiting room nearly half a century ago, I wouldn’t have seen Dr Kuriakose, and would probably have had my troubles before they could have been treated so smoothly. I’m grateful to her, for starting this chain of events. So, from the bottom of my heart, here’s to you, Dr Kuriakose.

"It’s amazing how medical technology has advanced. Half a century ago, for instance, cancer meant an almost certain death. Now, about a third of all cancer patients survive. Not all cancers yield readily to treatment, but there are new ways to detect cancer early, and to treat it successfully.
A little further back, in the early 20th century, pernicious anaemia meant almost certain death. Towards the mid-1920s, it became treatable. Its exact cause was discovered in the 1950s: a deficiency of vitamin B12. Treatment was simple, effective, and inexpensive.
 
There’ve been equally amazing advances in the treatment of diseases of the eye, for example. Sixty or seventy years ago, if you had a retinal detachment, the chances were that you’d go blind. Today, methods are so advanced that fixing a detachment is almost a matter of routine.
It’s not just technology: there are outstanding doctors who used some of these inventions to good effect. There’s Christiaan Barnard, for example, who did the first heart transplant back in the 1960s...
Doctors and technology have made huge differences to lives, but sometimes, in individual cases, there’s also the matter of luck, sometimes dumb luck. Let me give you an example.
 
It began in 1976, in Trivandrum, not long before my school exams. My parents were worried about the effect of all that swotting on my weak eyes: I’d used spectacles since I was 10, and the lenses got thicker every year. My parents thought that contact lenses would reduce the eyestrain, and decided that I deserved a pair, which was good news, because it meant a good excuse to bunk school.
The only place where you could check out contact lenses was the Government Ophthalmic  Hospital, which we knew very well, thanks to those weak eyes.
 
Dad and I went there one sunny morning, and bumped into a technician he knew. He told Dad to leave me with him and not to worry, so I found myself alone in the large, crowded waiting hall, with just enough money to get back home.
Soon a lady doctor turned up, led me to a small chamber furnished with benches, put some drops in my eyes. Some 15 minutes, she inserted lenses into my eyes, and told me to wait awhile. With the lenses in place, I could see rather better, and I enjoyed that for a while. But then, I’d been up half the night reading a new Alistair MacLean thriller, and the waiting was making me unbearably sleepy. Some minutes after the doctor left, I lay down on one of the benches and dozed off.
 
When I woke, the world was blurred again. I had no idea what had happened to the contact lenses. I thought they might have fallen off while I slept, so I spent the next few minutes on my hands and knees, feeling the entire dusty concrete floor for those fragile bits of glass, and despaired when I couldn’t find them.
When the doctor returned I told her I’d lost the lenses. Perhaps she was new: she wasn’t quite sure what to do so, she fetched help in the shape of an older lady doctor. This new doctor found the lenses at the sides of my eyes and retrieved them gently, all the while giving me a lecture on my irresponsible behaviour.
 
When the lenses were safely out, she relented, perhaps because of my nerdy looks, and offered me a bit of advice: if I studied regularly, she said, I wouldn’t have to lose sleep over exams. She saw my heavy spectacles, and continued, “Hmmm! Let me have a good look at your eyes.”
She led me to a dark room with instruments with glowing lights and many handles and levers. After a longish inspection, she shut off everything and led me back to the room with the benches. “You need some minor surgery in both eyes,” she said, “but we can’t do it here. You’ll have to go to Madras for it... It’s nothing very serious, but you have to get it done. Come back tomorrow with your father. Ask for me. My name is Mary Kuriakose.”
 
Next day, she spoke almost exclusively to Dad. “Your son’s retina has weak spots,” she said, “but we can strengthen those. One Dr Badrinath in Madras will do it.”
“He’s got his exams coming up,” Dad said. “Can it wait until after that?”
She smiled. “It’ll have to,” she said. “You’ll have to wait at least two months for your appointment.” She handed Dad a letter referring me to Dr Badrinath. “Write to him immediately.”
Dr Badrinath, was a large, reassuring man with an American accent. He took the time to explain the problem to me, and not just to Dad, and the procedure went off smoothly. One round of treatment wasn’t enough, and, over the next few years, it was repeated several times. Meanwhile, technology kept progressing.

"Hyderabad: If a scriptwriter had proposed a few years ago a logline for a movie which read – an actor from Punjabi, with a six-pack body, who has played a villain on screen for over two decades, finds a calling in the midst of a pandemic.
His real-life works make him the most beloved superstar across the country, the trust in him built rapidly as he works to connect, first with migrant workers and trying to help them, and as a second wave hits, responding to people from across the country, reaching out to him with a trust they repose in him greater than in governments. And in cineaste Telugu states, gods of decades slide down the charts, downed by a virus, leaving only one real star.
 
Such a script would never have found a director accepting it. Even the audiences would have found it beyond plausibility, even for a story. But when life scripts stories and reality screens it, not for two hours but years, anything is possible. Such has been the script starring Sonu Sood since Coronavirus spread its menacing tentacles and brought down every order of society and all semblances of sanity.
But in dark times, heroes arise from unexpected spots. Lending help, giving hope, sharing light, redefining love, and metamorphosing fan following.
 
Speaking to Deccan Chronicle about his inner motivations to emerge from the fringes of celebritydom to becoming a trusted icon of a ravage nation’s people, Sonu Sood, in a soft soothing voice of a healer rather than a preferred negative actor of the movie screen, said, “growing up in Moga, Punjab, I saw my mother, a teacher, give free tuition classes for decades. Outside my father’s shop, there would always be a langar, where I too would serve food. It was a lesson ingrained for life that you must always be there to serve in whatever capacity you have.”
 
When asked about the incident that prompted him to emerge out of lockdown and pandemic fears to become a frontline hero, Mr Sood said, “last year, when I started hearing stories of migrant workers, I knew I could no longer sit in the security and comfort of my home. As a migrant worker myself, though privileged and lucky, I could empathise with their angst. It started with serving food and giving basic financial help to organising to help them in larger numbers.”
The legend grew quickly because of the vacuum. None of India’s conventional heroes – film stars, cricketers, billionaires – were there to really make a significant difference. Sood’s rise in being recognised as a saviour is also a deep reflection of the indifference of the others.
 
How do you feel about being recognised and trusted so much by people that they tag you on twitter for help before government agencies or ministers? Do you feel pressure to deliver?
He smiles, and in one of the most humane voices I have heard in a long time, replies, “there is no pressure when a friend or family member expects you to stand for them. It is no different. Every bit of time, money and effort I can muster, I am out there because I know somewhere, someone who has reached out to me is waiting and expecting. It is a call I must respond to, and I can’t let them down.”
 
I scratch my head, a bit bewildered. Is it a mere PR exercise? Or did I get connected to Dalia Lama by mistake? It is, I do not think it is his fault that others in the cine world have used charity as a ticket to sell more tickets for their next release. Last year, we were stuck with the tragic story of another SS in Bollywood – Sushant Singh. This SS has risen now to become India’s superhero, without a cape, just a twitter handle.
Are you a bit embarrassed Sonu, I ask him, that others in your film fraternity, Bollywood or Tollywood, who have received greater stardom and earned far more money and influence, never cared to take up work like yours in one of our worst years ever? He answers candidly, but with sangfroid. “You can’t force a feeling of wanting to help people. It can’t even be taught beyond a point. It must come from within.”
 
What next? Will this image harm your film career? Next time any film fans see him on screen as a villain, will the portrayal be convincing? “I am not thinking of the next film. Just my next SOS call.”
He disappears to do good for someone, somewhere. A villain has refined heroism, forever. My vote for the biggest star in films in India in a dark year – Sonu Sood.

"His bio on Instagram catches the eye. Cinematographer and director of photography for a NatGeo film on Black Panthers the first in the world of wildlife. Hailing from Hyderabad’s illustrious Jung family, Shaaz’s wildlife images have earned him a place in BBC news.
 
An accomplishment that his proud aunt, Kareena Kapoor highlighted on her Insta account. We chat with this talented youngster on the jungle life.
Q What has kept you busy right now?
I’ve dedicated the past five years to documenting melanistic leopards in the jungles of South India and helped produce a feature film for National Geographic recently, for which I was the Director of Photography. It took us two and a half years to finish the film. It feels great to make a film, for the first time in the world of wildlife, on a black panther.
 
Q Your involvement with the family owned wildlife resorts in Kabini and South Africa?
My parents (Saad Bin Jung and Sangeeta) are avid wildlifers and were one of the first pioneers for eco-tourism in Karnataka. That passionate outburst happened after I graduated from University in 2010. I moved to Nagarhole National Park and helped establish an eco-friendly wildlife resort on the banks of the Kabini reservoir. This is where I spend most of my time guiding, photographing and making films.
Q How did your interest in wildlife photography evolve?
It happened after I saw my first leopard, which sparked my love affair with the woods. The camera had the ability to immortalise moments, relish life, protect ecosystems, inspire movements and spark change.
 
Q What has been the most thrilling moment while shooting wildlife?
It would be on safari in the Serengeti this year. I was guiding a group of six avid photographers in an open jeep and we were parked in the tall grass with a herd of Water Buffalos, which are considered to be one of the most dangerous animals in Africa. We knew there was a hungry lioness around but we had no idea where she was. After several anxious minutes, one of the buffalos sensed her presence and was now very disturbed. We were surrounded by an angry herd and they had the power to upturn our jeep in seconds. After a few nervous seconds, the lioness broke cover and charged at a buffalo calf. It caused a stampede and one of the bulls, in a raging fit, destroyed the left tyre of our car. It was terrifying!
 
Q What has your time in the jungle taught you? Is your wife as passionate about nature as you are?
The jungle has taught me the art of patience. It’s inhabitants, such as the beautiful leopards, have been my mentors. They’ve taught me to live by the day and how to appreciate the passing of time, and not let it worry us. My wife Nayantara grew up in New York. After we got married, she moved to the jungle and has quickly adapted, almost like a leopard! She enjoys the wilderness and helped produce the National Geographic feature film on the black panther.

"Nellore: The Ayush department team studying the concoction prepared by Bonigi Anandaiah at Krishnapatnam and hawked as a cure for Covid-19 cannot be termed an Ayurvedic medicine.
They said that Ayush protocols and guidelines do not accept these preparations as Ayurvedic drugs. They felt that the preparations were similar to traditional local medicines, hinting that there is no need for any licence.
 
Speaking to this newspaper, Commissioner of Ayush and head of the team, Col. V. Ramulu, said that there are no harmful ingredients in the substance being given by Anandaiah, including the eye drops.
“Anandaiah prepared all them before us and the process is very simple for anyone to produce. Moreover, he is willing to share the formula with the public,” he said.
The Ayush official said that Anandaiah has been using herbs including locally available leaves such as neem, mango and jamun apart from honey, pepper, green camphor, nutmeg, black cumin, turmeric and cinnamon among many other items, “which we use daily for preparing food items.”
 
In the eye drops, Anandaiah has been using pepper, mulla vankaya and honey, Col Ramulu noted. He said that the preparation cannot be prescribed for Covid-19 as the formula is one among hundreds of local remedies for different ailments. Citing an instance, he pointed to the popular Puttur treatment for broken bones.
Col Ramulu said they would submit a report to the government on their study. It is up to the government to take a decision, he added.

"For some high-fliers the party hasn’t stopped despite the coronavirus pandemic. A Hyderabad jeweller who threw a lavish birthday bash attended by at least 100 people died of COVID-19 on Saturday. This is not the first such event, since India began unlocking.
In Bihar, a wedding ceremony in rural Patna on June 15 set off the biggest coronavirus infection chain so far, and the groom was among those who died while around a 100 were infected.
In May, a Hyderabad shop owner threw a party after which 45 tested positive in May.
 
In Tamil Nadu, a DMK man who organised a bash for his birthday in Thiruvallur district on June 14 has tested positive for Coronavirus along with three guests.
It may be recalled, singer Kanika Kapoor’s Lucknow party in March exposed several to the coronavirus.
Why are people finding it so difficult to act in accordance with containment demands? Don’t they realise how their actions can affect others?
These are classic examples of the misplaced belief that ‘Nothing will happen to me’. Sanjay Gulabani, chairman, P. Mangatram Jewellers, says,
 
“Each one of us needs to act responsibly. For the economy to not get further beaten out of shape, the lockdown was relaxed. The purpose of the lockdown was to create awareness and get people ready to adapt to the new codes. It is up to us to be judicious in protecting our health,” he pointed out.
“There was general carelessness and apathy towards the problem,” feels Uday Pilani, entrepreneur and investor, who owns hotels in the UK, as well as the FinTech and Management Consulting company in India.
“The Agarwal Marwadi Samaj now has over a thousand affected. The thing is that the recovery rate is excellent, so they are losing fear,” he adds.
 
It’s been difficult to curb the jet-setting crowd from organising parties and society events. “Now is not the time to show your status; it’s time to show responsibility. The vast majority of the people who are defying calls for social distancing are not realising that it’s not about just them... it’s about taking a risk with their families and friends as well. It’s time we all get responsible and accept that precaution is better than cure,” says Madhu Jain, an entrepreneur.
While the world’s scientists are working towards finding a cure and vaccines for COVID-19, we need to take all preventive measures, feels Bina Mehta, another entrepreneur.
 
“Social distancing will only ‘flatten the curve’. Let us all understand and respect our own lives and value others’ lives too. It is a sin to invite people to events, and an even bigger sin to be part of any event,” says Bina.
Life doesn’t have to stop because of the Coronavirus, but it’s smart to re-evaluate priorities, feels entrepreneur Vinod Ranka,. “I was invited to few parties and weddings, but I declined the invitations,” he says, giving an example of how priorities should change.

"Hyderabad: On turning 43 in May two year ago, Pushpak, a highly successful senior executive with a global fin-tech firm located in the Financial District, made several changes in his lifestyle. These included getting a farm house in the town, buying a new SUV and promising to block his calendar for a family holiday abroad.
His fitness goals included joining a gym, cycling and running. His life revolved around the stress of managing his own wealth portfolio as also his financial goals and ambitions.
 
Two years later, the SUV means far less to him. His farmhouse seems a trifle less important.
He has lost two members in his extended family, a close friend and several friends. He has failed at least in one case; despite all the money, he failed to get an ICU bed for a close relative in another city.
He now has a new priority; having peace of mind. After many trials, he has chosen an unlikely route – meditation – to achieve his goal.
Speaking on the eve of World Meditation Day, Pushpak says, “I knew it but missed the significance of such an elementary truth in life. Life is all about breathing. We breathe, we are alive. For all my life, I took it for granted. Today, anxiety and stress, fear and worry are all taking a toll on my life. Corona has raised questions on what we thought was our success. The calm of being aware of my own breath has been the greatest learning.”
 
He’s alone now. Hordes of people have been forced by the pandemic and its continuing challenges to seek and find mental peace through meditation.
Kamala Chirravuri, one of the top-notch yoga meditation teachers in Hyderabad, has celebrities -- those with serious mental issues and corporate executives -- seeking her help. She offers them counseling and personalized yoga-meditation solutions.
“Meditation as defined by Patanjali comprises dharana and dhyana. Dharana is singularly focusing all our conscious attention on one object, the starting point of meditation. Dhyana is the highest level we can achieve, wherein we are immersed and become one with the flow,” she says.
 
When asked about her heightened interest in meditation, Kamala replies, “It feels like we are in the midst of a mythological pralaya. To face the unrest outside, we must find strength, peace and calm within. Once we learn to focus our attention within, and become aware of our breath, we find a center and we reduce the imbalance that causes stress, anxiety and unrest.”
A trainer in the Krishnamacharya tradition, Kamala is comfortable with the diversity of meditation techniques. “There are many techniques from Vipassana, the focus on breath and sensations, to chanting of ‘Om’ to visualizations. Anything that works for you! But the one constant in life is our breathing.”
 
Sanjay Sehgal, a director at Heartfulness, says, “In our technique, we begin with thought as a focal point and dive deeper into the heart. This is a 76-years-old technique of diving deeper and achieving a higher level of consciousness.”
He says, “People may reach out for various reasons. Relieving your stress or finding peace is easy. I often say, you can find peace with a peg of good whiskey or if you can avoid fighting with your spouse. But finding sustainable inner peace, to be a better person, is harder, which is where we take you to.”
 
The heart-centred meditation, which has millions of practitioners, over 14,000 trainers and over 260 ashrams in 130 nations, renders its service all free.
When quizzed about the recent spurt in interest, Sehgal says, “Even a basic practice of pranayamam will help you at a physical level. It expands your lungs and eases the flow of air from your nose to inside. It can most certainly help during Covid times. Bad things can happen to anyone. But a great gift of meditation is that it helps you alter and find a better sense of control over your own reactions and responses. I have seen in my own family that those who meditate had a distinctly different and qualitatively better response to the emergencies arising out of the Covid pandemic than to those who don’t meditate.”
 
Trainers have adopted technology in the Covid season to ensure that meditation can be taught in the virtual mode. From an institutional meditation like Heartfulness, whose global headquarters is in Hyderabad and whose spiritual leader Daaji has held remote virtual sessions to individual trainers like Kamala, to those who are doing sessions through Zoom or Google Meets, technology is helping bring together the agitated with those who guide you to inner peace.

"Who’s that attorney?
The induction of a law officer from Gujarat as additional solicitor general has suddenly turned up the legal heat on many in the national capital, particularly those belonging to the UPA regime. Senior lawyer S.V. Raju was appointed as ASG and brought from Gujarat.
 
The legal community is abuzz with reports that Mr Raju has a direct line to the “Big Two” and is keeping them informed about pending and fresh legal cases. AICC treasurer Ahmed Patel is already facing the heat from the Enforcement Directorate. More drama and trouble for the Congress is expected in the coming months.
Like father, unlike son
Shourya Doval is a man of many shades. Hailing from the Garhwal region, young Doval seems keen to chalk out his own path distinct from his illustrious father, national security advisor Ajit Doval.
 
During the 2019 parliamentary polls, Uttarakhand was rife with rumour that Shourya would be fielded from the Pauri Garhwal seat but local political dynamics played out differently. Shourya has been taking an active interest in the socio-cultural activities in the hill state. He was recently spotted in an online programme that was organised by Congress leader Harish Rawat.
Nath still in reckoning
Madhya Pradesh is the number one tiger state in the country. But who is tiger number one? A political debate and war of words is raging in the central Indian state with both chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia delivering Salman Khan’s dialogue, “Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai”.
 
On the political barometer, Scindia seems one up on Chouhan having managed to get all his supporters inducted in the Chouhan ministry while the CM cut a sorry figure in having to keep out many of his loyal supporters who were ministerial colleagues in the previous BJP regime.
Crucial Assembly by-polls in 24 seats will be held shortly where all 24 (mostly MLAs who had defected from the Congress to BJP with Scindia) will be in the fray. The Congress is hoping to get at least half of them defeated. If that happens, it will be Kamal Nath’s turn to say, “Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai”.
 
Cricketing ‘estate’
While speculation was rife that the late Arun Jaitley’s daughter Sonali Jaitley Bakshi may join politics, the former minister's son Rohan is said to be keen to pursue his dad’s passion for cricket administration.
The Delhi and District Cricket Association poll is on the cards to fill six vacant posts — president, treasurer and four directors. The two key positions of president and treasurer have been vacant since Rajat Sharma tendered his resignation on November 29, 2019, and O.P. Sharma was disqualified from office as treasurer. Ombudsman Justice (Retd) Deepak Verma ordered Sharma’s disqualification as treasurer as he is an elected member of the Delhi legislative Assembly. If Rohan contests and wins he will be occupying a post that was once held by Arun Jaitley.
 
PM’s subterfuge
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise visit to Leh was well-planned. Informed sources say that as per strategy, defence minister Rajnath Singh’s name was first announced. Hours before Modi’s visit, the defence minister called off his tour to Ladakh where Chinese forces have adopted an aggressive posture. Rajnath was kept in the loop throughout. He was first to go public in lauding the PM’s inspiring speech delivered at Nimu base.

Ombudsman Justice (Retd) Deepak Verma ordered Sharma’s disqualification as treasurer as he is an elected member of the Delhi legislative Assembly. If Rohan contests and wins he will be occupying a post that was once held by Arun Jaitley.
 
PM’s subterfuge
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise visit to Leh was well-planned. Informed sources say that as per strategy, defence minister Rajnath Singh’s name was first announced. Hours before Modi’s visit, the defence minister called off his tour to Ladakh where Chinese forces have adopted an aggressive posture. Rajnath was kept in the loop throughout. He was first to go public in lauding the PM’s inspiring speech delivered at Nimu base.

"Hyderabad: A few organisations are striving hard to make sure that frontline warriors against Covid-19 pandemic and other caregivers are not deprived of food, groceries and other bare necessities during their fight against the pandemic.
One such organisation, Give Hope Foundation, in association with a privately operated restaurant, started a campaign to help frontline Covid workers each day. As a part of its drive, the members of the organisation are providing protective gear, masks and nutritious healthy meals to them. Anybody can participate and donate groceries and other food items by scanning the Give Hope Foundation QR code.
 
Speaking to this newspaper, Vasumana Ghosh, a representative of the organisation said, “We have been active for some time, but in the last two weeks we have had some tremendous response for the drive.”
“We have conducted various activities like supplying food and groceries to at old-age homes, orphanages, GHMC workers and schools during these Covid times,” she said.  
During the pandemic, the group has distributed Rs 1.5 lakh worth masks and sanitisers to law and order departments, traffic police, GHMC workers and sanitation workers, she added.

"HYDERABAD: The air inside is cool, but thick with Coronavirus. Among the 13 patients in a Covid-19 ICU, some are on ventilators as their bodies wracked by the virus try and fight back the disease.
The sight is pathetic. The tube inside the throat adds to their cough. Each time a patient coughs, countless virus particles are spewed into the air.
 
Inside the blue full body protection kits, doctors, nurses and other support staff go about their tasks methodically. At stake are the lives of infected patients who, along with their families, have placed their faith in god the almighty and the hospital staff.
The staff in attendance is practising a new regimen of long shifts on slim meals and controlled fluid intake. “If anyone wants to take a break, they will take off the PPE kits and spend 20 minutes in the restroom and spend another 20 minutes putting on a fresh kit. In the meanwhile, we need to find a replacement for that person for a similar duration,” explained Dr K. Subba Reddy, chief intensivist at Apollo Hospital.
 
Last year, when patients began streaming into the ICU at Apollo in Jubilee Hills, there was fear and apprehension among the staff. Everyone was worried and scared. It was Annapurna, a senior housekeeping staffer, who gave the medics the confidence to carry on.
“I had attended to the requirements of TB, AIDS and Chicken Pox patients. We overcame those situations with courage and we can overcome this too,” she had told them. “That gave us a lot of motivation and strength. Then there was one of our nurses Pyun Su Klin, who lost her sister and brother in the first wave. Yet, she said she will not take a break or go home, but continued to work, saying there were so many pat-ients around to be taken care of,” Dr Subba Reddy recalled. While the stress of working to save lives every minute is itself a challenging experience, so is it that an ICU staffer cannot mingle with own family as a matter of precaution.
 
The air in a Covid-19 ICU is thick with the virus. Intubated patients are coughing, generating aerosols carrying the virus particles.
Subba Reddy, over the past one year, has only been seeing his 11-year-old daughter from a distance, in a different apartment where she lives with her grandparents. Going nearer meant a risk to the child.
Coming off a prolonged 72-hour shift, Dr K. Swarna Deepak, also of Apollo, told Deccan Chronicle on Sunday: “Sometimes you just cannot take a break. Over the last couple of days, we opened more ICUs for Covid patients.”
 
And if a hospital runs out of ventilators, the doctors and nurses would resort to sheer physical stamina, drawing every ounce of strength they have to keep a patient alive.
Using a bag ventilator, they keep pumping, squeezing the bag to push oxygen into a patient’s lungs. “And when one arm gets tired, you just switch arms and continue. As long as it takes,” Dr Deepak said.
Elsewhere, at KIMS hospital, Dr Sambit Sahu, a critical and intensive care specialist, talks wistfully of what the scene was just a few weeks ago. “We barely had three patients in the Covid19 ICU. Then it hit us like a storm. All of a sudden, it was 50 patients; and by the time we realised what was happening, we had a 100 of them in these ICUs,” he said.
 
Unlike last year, Covid19 was a novel disease and what everyone heard about it came from other parts of the world. The second wave is different. There was a sense of mental fatigue, of coming out of a stressful year. “We just got out of a traumatic year. And the feeling as the patients began pouring in was Oh God! Not Again!,” Dr Sahu said.
As the virus keeps flying around in the ICUs, the doctors have just one prayer on their lips; that they be able to save the life of every patient and that people at large followed the safety measures and helped medical professionals by keeping the case loads low.
 
“If that does not happen soon, we are in for a disaster,” said Dr Subba Reddy.

The coronavirus crisis has crumpled the social fabric of our lives and the fashion industry like. Be it the way we address our financial goals or the way we dress.
Even as fashion titans like Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci and some Indian designers are casting their bread upon the waters to create safe and sustainable clothing (including PPE), the most that we can do is wait. And watch!
Fashion historians point out that people changed their dressing style after the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the Great Depression and World War II. The 2020 Covid-19 pandemic is no exception.
 
With retailers and clothing units shutting shop, and millions of workers scrambling to make ends meet, nobody frankly knows the future of fashion or the new ‘quarantrends’.
A la Mode
Some designers say dressier days are on the horizon as people would want to spread cheer and positive vibes. Some opine dull and somber attire goes with the current mood. Yet, a few others are optimistic of the easy-on-the-eye-and-pocket florals.
The online market of second-hand and recycled clothes, shoes and accessories has already seen a spike. You may nod and naff in equal measure, but it looks like Back to Basics!
 
Ritu Kumar, the doyenne of Indian fashion industry, who began her career in 1969 with just four hand block printers and two tables in a small village near Calcutta (now Kolkata), says that there were recessionary trends in the fashion industry even before the pandemic.
“Business had slowed down after demonetisation. Now, there will be a trend of need-based buying. I won’t be surprised if we are pushed back by another 20 years,” says Kumar, whose understanding of ancient Indian designs, traditional crafts and Indian fashion market is unmatched.
 
She adds that you cannot compare the Indian fashion industry to the international ones. “The fashion industry in the western world has been there for over 100-150 years. The Indian fashion industry has been around for only 30-40 years.”
However, Kumar feels the saree, kurta and kurtis will make a comeback to beat the corona blues. “A saree suits all occasions. It is low on maintenance too. Men usually spend on branded shirts and trousers. But now people will move towards ethnic wear. The kurta will be the much-favoured choice for men and women,” she says.
 
Beleaguered Workforce
India has an estimated 16 million crafts-people working in the textile industry.  A majority of them in rural areas and are involved in the most intricate work like weaving, embroidery and creation of embellishments etc.
These craftsmen have mastered their craft over centuries and passed it on from one generation to the other. The pandemic has brought about an “unprecedented” crisis.
Today, thousands of craftsmen are without work. Customers are still hesitant to enter malls and shops to buy clothes although there has been a spike in online shopping.
 
Jugnu Gosrani, a Mumbai-based designer, who creates free-spirited clothes, says all her sales are online.
“We are all saddled with unsold merchandise. This month, I managed to sell kurtis, dresses and skirts online in my housing society itself. Customers order online. I leave the outfit outside their door in a sealed plastic bag,” explains Jugnu. She is certain that people will stick to affordable and sustainable clothes.
The only ‘In thing’ right now are protective masks. Jeans, joggers and leggings are also in demand. Whether you step out to run errands or go for a jog. The mask is here to stay for a long time. “I’m making kalamkari masks from the leftover fabrics,” Jugnu adds.
 
No Big Spenders  
Designer Rina Dhaka feels it is impossible to quantify the losses since it is interlinked from retail giants to exporters to the migrant workers. “Work is a struggle and one is trying to get up again,” she says.
After the pandemic, Rina plans to move back to crafts, wovens and sustainable models of fashion. “I will also simplify the couture. Maybe more as singles or separates to make the spending easier,” she says.  
Grapevine from the fashion circuit tells us that nearly four designers and their loved ones have had a close brush with the virus. Earlier, designers had to run the gauntlet of TV cameras and fashion photographers.
 
Now, it will take plenty of pluck to re-fashion one’s business model and pull through the mess. The Fashion Design Council of India has already announced a Covid-19 Support Fund for small businesses and young designers in need.
Ritu Kumar is certain that fast fashion will be out. “In India, people purchase clothes for functions and festivals (Diwali, Eid, Christmas, Baisakhi) unlike the west where the fashion ramp is dictated by changing seasons and colours.” Kumar is optimistic that people will bounce back. “We will have to focus on ‘Make in India’ to pull through this crisis,” she says.  
 
Make Every Outfit Count
Today, millions of people are either out of work or have taken pay cuts. The recession has forced people to set their priorities and rethink their spending.  Nishit Gupta, director of KALKI says people are tired of this panic mode.
“Fashion trends will vary as the world slowly emerges from the global quarantine. With weddings now becoming more intimate, smaller in size, the fusion trends will find favour with both brides and bridesmaids. Mirror lehengas, organza skirts, pre-stitched sarees, necklet gowns, dhoti-crop tops in handwoven fabrics and hand-done embroideries with traditional textile techniques will trend. It will also help support the rural artisans and handloom communities,” says Nishit.
 
The pandemic shockwaves have hit every industry. The ‘new normal’ will make us slow down, and reinvent how we view consumption and production.
“If you view forecasts, by next year from a slated -4% drop this year in the GDP, we may be able to achieve a growth of 4% in 2021, provided we take control of the production and job creation by being self sufficient,” says Bahaar Dhawan Rohatgi, a Delhi-based lawyer-cum-visual artist and influencer.
She hopes the fashion sector will become more responsible and sustainable.
 
“I hope aficionados will promote products that employ environmental-friendly, fair practices, minimise waste and boast functionality. We may witness a tipping point where designers will be drawn to celebrate austerity, emphasising a classless society (remember post war ‘Austerity Britain drive’ in the 1940s) signifying affordability, access to leisure, health, value life and maintaining balance,” says Bahaar. Perhaps need-based sustainable dressing is the glamour we’ve been missing!

"HYDERABAD: Doctors and nurses attending to Covid-19 patients and posting their videos on social media sum up the trauma they experience in Covid wards, where the pandemic is staging a dance of death and devastation. End of the day, they often break down into tears.
Medical professionals handling the dying patients say counseling their families on the wait outside is itself a huge task and painful experience. Cases are one too many, hospitals are running out of beds, there is shortage of support systems and life-saving equipment, and the virus’s variants are often difficult to identify.
 
The medical staff is face-to-face with death and strained also by the extra hours of work day after day, in iterations. Worse, they are exposed closer to this deadly virus than the general public.
Many doctors, nurses and other medical staff have lost their lives while treating the patients. Here is a war-like situation. They are also scared about the possibility that they carry the killer virus home and spread it to the family.
Alongside comes the people’s irresponsible behavior, couldn’t-care-less attitude, the mass gatherings, political rallies, cinema craze, all helping spread the deadly virus. All these are happening when the frontline Covid warriors are staking their lives and attending to patients non-stop and gasping for breath.
 
Dr Anita Rego, mental health professional and psychotherapist, said: “As frontline workers they deal with the real miseries of the patients, those who are struggling on their beds, those who are breathing their last. The stories of medical success are often clouded by these realities. We need to build an envelope of caring professionals and psychotherapists on whom they can fall back and build their strength and energy.”
She added: “Providing healthcare workers with stronger networks of specialist mental health services is not yet a priority with our health system and we need to advocate it.”
 
Dr Daljeet Kaur, consultant psychiatrist, said: “There will be frustration, stress and anxiety. The medical staff is disheartened because the situation is not in their control. When it comes to the doctors’ level, the coronavirus variants are unpredictable and it is difficult for them to understand the prognosis of patients.”
“The stress level, though, varies between individual and individual. While a senior doctor might be stressed and overwhelmed, a nursing staff or paramedic on the frontline and spending more time with the patient is more depressed seeing the conditions from close quarters.”
 
She suggested: “Counselors should be allocated for patients and the attenders. This will reduce the load of the consulting doctors. The medical staff should also be counseled on a periodical basis. Mental health of the medical staff should be a priority.”
 
QUOTES
Dr J Shivkumar, senior cardiologist: “The medical professionals are always under stress due to various reasons. Now, in the Covid situation, they are putting their lives on stake and saving the patient, whereas the general public is game with flaunting all the Covid protocols, further straining the health sector facilities.”
 
Dr Ashish Chauhan, Covid care expert at Apollo Hospital: “With an exposure some 100 to 1,000 times more that of the general public, the health care professionals are dead scared while performing their duties. Currently they are working like a soldier, ready to be martyred during a war. A sincere thanks by the patients and their relatives is what they expect.” 
“As per an IMA study, an average Indian doctor lives 10 years lesser than the normal population. Now, some 70 to 80 per cent of the patients are treated and they walkout healthy whereas some 20 to 30 per cent die. This is not an easy sight to digest.”
 
Dr  Karuna Madap, paediatrician, Covid-care: “Health care warriors should protect themselves and their families first. If they are physically and mentally strong, they can take care of hundreds patients. The medical staff should constantly take proper counseling for their mental health from a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist. There should be some organisation to come forward and provide nutritious food for the medical staff.”
Dr Sahithi Reddy Lebaka, junior doctor at Fever Hospital, Nallakunta: “Wearing plastic PPE kits for hours in his summer is not an easy task. Restless extra shifts due to constant patient flow, insufficient medical supplies and instruments, all these mean for us a mental fatigue.”
 
Dr M A Faroqui, professor, PG department of Unani medicine, Tibbi College, Charminar: “On Wednesday, two doctors in this Unani hospital have perished due to Covid-19. Over time, we will be drained out. There has to be equal participation of the public to overcome the present grim situation. When that fails to happen, we become mentally upset.”
Laxman Rudavath, Telangana nursing officers association general secretary: “Nurses are the first to serve patients. Even in these deadly situations, we take care of patients to the best. As we see around too many deaths and when a lot of patients sufferings, we naturally get depressed. We also have a fear that we are taking home the virus to our family.”
 
Jyothi, staff nurse, King Koti Hospital (Covid Centre): “We are exposed to so much of trauma during this pandemic. There is a sudden spike in the cases. When we return home we are out of our mood. Yes, there should be some mental health counselors for the medical workers.”
Sarala Kancharla, staff nursem Gandhi Hospital (State-assigned Covid-19 hospital): “The pouring in of patients, all around us, it’s suffering and suffering…  the shortage of staff, lack of support, our exposure to this deadly virus, the constant fear of us getting infected, we are stressed a lot these days.”
 
Ravindar Reddy, sanitization supervisor: “This wave made many of us think: is this worth taking risk? We are also seeing discrimination near our place, we are very depressed these days, and yet work should go on.”
Haseena Begum, Ayah, Nelofer Hospital: “Seeing the sufferings of patients, especially little children who are infected by coronavirus, makes us more sad and these days we don’t even feel like eating. We all are so scared!”

"As a reprisal to China’s incursions into Indian territory, the Narendra Modi government has banned 59 Chinese apps because they were allegedly ""prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order"". A majority of these apps were popular amongst India’s 500 million internet users.
India is the fastest growing consumer internet market in the world, with 19 billion downloads in 2019. That positions India as the second largest market for app downloads. But does aatmanirbhar India have the alternatives to these apps that can quickly fill the space vacated by the Chinese apps?

"As a reprisal to China’s incursions into Indian territory, the Narendra Modi government has banned 59 Chinese apps because they were allegedly ""prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order"". A majority of these apps were popular amongst India’s 500 million internet users.
India is the fastest growing consumer internet market in the world, with 19 billion downloads in 2019. That positions India as the second largest market for app downloads. But does aatmanirbhar India have the alternatives to these apps that can quickly fill the space vacated by the Chinese apps?
 
We scoured App Store and Play Store and found that there were indeed several Indian alternatives to most of the banned Chinese mobile applications. The ban on Chinese applications offers an opportunity for India’s tech ecosystem.

"Cast: Sushmita Sen, Chandrachur Singh, Sikandar Kher, Ankur Bhatia, Alexx ONell, Namit Das, Manish Choudhary, Sohaila Kapur, Jayant Kripalani, Vishwajeet Pradhan, Vikas Kumar, Virti Vaghani, Viren Vazirani, Pratyaksh Panwar, Sugandha Garg, Maya Sarao 
Creator & director: Ram Madhvani, Sandeep Modi
 
Rating: ***1/2
Let me just say it straight up — Sushmita Sen is insanely attractive. And Aarya, created and directed by Ram Madhvani and Sandeep Modi, is a riveting watch.
Sushmita is sexy, glamorous, glowing, fit, and she commands and controls the camera’s lens as if it were her drooling fan. Sushmita is also a star and she brings all her star power to ground Aarya. But Sushmita isn’t a great actress. Her acting chops are limited to giving a few “looks”.
That's why the show’s directors have had to conspire with cinematographer Harshvir Oberai and editors (Khushboo Ra, Abhimanyu Chaudhary) to cut, chop, fade, zoom in, go slomo, use every trick available to insinuate that she is acting, moving, while keeping her gorgeous face and its one expression on the screen.
 
But Sushmita Sen’s repertoire is too tiny, too meagre for us to be fooled.
We love her warm charm, but hope that by season two she grows from just giving a “look” and learns to transition from one expression to another without the help of editing.
Aarya is based on the Dutch series Penoza (meaning, the underworld), which began airing in 2010, was a huge hit and went on for five seasons. Penoza told the story of Carmen, an Amsterdam woman — a wife, a mother, and then a widow and a godmother — who is forced to take over her husband’s business to pay off his various debts.
 
It was remade in the US because of the universal appeal of its themes of love, loyalty, betrayal and family ties, but it didn’t fly. Now the series, about a mother protecting her children, has found a happy, natural home in Rajasthan, India.
Set in the desert state's rotting mini-royalty, Aarya’s first season is based on the original almost scene-by-scene, with just a few changes thrown in to fit its milieu.   
The series' first and last episodes open with Aarya (Sushmita Sen) hanging upside down on TRX straps, a familiar sight for those who follow Ms Sen’s Instagram account.
 
In between these two scenes is the story of three business partners, a stolen drug consignment, a murder and a woman torn between her two families -- father, mother, sister and brother on one side, and husband, daughter and two sons on the other.
A cop is after business secrets, the mafia is after the drugs, a business partner has begun to unravel and everyone seems to be hiding something.
As Aarya takes charge, some things go as planned, while others don’t.
Another murder, a kidnapping, deceit. With every threat coiling around her family, tightening its grip, Aarya's moral compass shifts to one that is beyond all moral considerations -- the mother who will protect her brood at all cost.
 
Every time things get too dreary, Aarya distracts itself and us by playing some LP records of Bollywood oldies — to take a deep breath and relive happy memories before the next dark twist.
This is the series' trick that keeps us hooked. Like Aarya, we too yearn for the husband-wife in love, the sunshine days of a happy family…

I have a very simple test of how good a serial is. If I binge watch it in one go while battling sleep and despite a busy early morning looming, then it's very good.
If I can take a break, but must then return to it asap, then it's good. And if I take a break but then browse around for other stuff, it's blah.
 
Aarya is good. Quite good, actually. But I could take a day’s break.
It's not Pataal Lok good, though Aarya more than makes up for the dearth of women in that masculine, macho series.
Half-way through Aarya I could figure who is behind it all, yet I was immersed in the intrigues of this world of Audis and Mercs, mistresses and sex, because of the excellent ensemble of actors and its brilliant screenplay.
Though it’s almost a copy-cut-paste job of the original, Aarya has a high production value, it looks and feels posh and its big scenes are made up of lovely, small details.
 
Aarya has a long list of actors, and each one gets a character that either has layers and complications or grand, powerful scenes. And while everyone is good, some are just stand-out fabulous.  
Chandrachur Singh as Aarya's husband Tej is delightfully normal and adorable. Jayant Kripalani as Aarya's father Zorawar, with Sikandar Kher as his point man Daulat, are deliciously dark and together they create the swag and rot of Rajasthani royalty.
Namit Das as the coke-snorting Jawahar is manic, unpredictable, and Vikas Kumar as the earnest but annoying ACP Khan creates a character that will outlive the series.
 
Manish Choudhary as the Russians’ peddler-distributor Shekhawat, Vishwajeet Pradhan as his man Sampat, Sohaila Kapur as Zorawar's bitter, day-drinking wife Rajeshwari, and Maya Sarao as Maya all have a few big scenes and with each one they add muscle and moxie to the series.
 
Even the three kids — played by Virti Vaghani, Viren Vazirani and Pratyaksh Panwar — are measured, memorable.
Writers Sandeep Srivastav and Anu Singh Choudhary have embellished Sushmita’s character with items from her life, making it, in some ways, an extension of the actor’s own personality.
 
Apart from the hanging routine, there's rousing chanting of stanzas from the Gita, again a regular feature on Sushmita's Instagram.
Sushmita's character, which has been given an Eileen Fisher type of layered, minimalist but chic mommy wardrobe, keeps calling all her children “Bachcha”, instead of by their name.
A trait of a woman who is a natural caregiver, perhaps. But it’s jarring and sticks out as an affectation because of Sushmita's studied attempt at ""acting"",
Sushmita has powerful screen presence, but her dialogue delivery is the sort you hear in acting classes — rehearsed, deliberate, read out.
 
She's got everything going for her. All she needs now is a little fluidity and to shed some of her diva gold dust.

In between these two scenes is the story of three business partners, a stolen drug consignment, a murder and a woman torn between her two families -- father, mother, sister and brother on one side, and husband, daughter and two sons on the other.
A cop is after business secrets, the mafia is after the drugs, a business partner has begun to unravel and everyone seems to be hiding something.
As Aarya takes charge, some things go as planned, while others don’t.
Another murder, a kidnapping, deceit. With every threat coiling around her family, tightening its grip, Aarya's moral compass shifts to one that is beyond all moral considerations -- the mother who will protect her brood at all cost.
 
Every time things get too dreary, Aarya distracts itself and us by playing some LP records of Bollywood oldies — to take a deep breath and relive happy memories before the next dark twist.
This is the series' trick that keeps us hooked. Like Aarya, we too yearn for the husband-wife in love, the sunshine days of a happy family…

I have a very simple test of how good a serial is. If I binge watch it in one go while battling sleep and despite a busy early morning looming, then it's very good.
If I can take a break, but must then return to it asap, then it's good. And if I take a break but then browse around for other stuff, it's blah.
 
Aarya is good. Quite good, actually. But I could take a day’s break.
It's not Pataal Lok good, though Aarya more than makes up for the dearth of women in that masculine, macho series.
Half-way through Aarya I could figure who is behind it all, yet I was immersed in the intrigues of this world of Audis and Mercs, mistresses and sex, because of the excellent ensemble of actors and its brilliant screenplay.
Though it’s almost a copy-cut-paste job of the original, Aarya has a high production value, it looks and feels posh and its big scenes are made up of lovely, small details.
 
Aarya has a long list of actors, and each one gets a character that either has layers and complications or grand, powerful scenes. And while everyone is good, some are just stand-out fabulous.  
Chandrachur Singh as Aarya's husband Tej is delightfully normal and adorable. Jayant Kripalani as Aarya's father Zorawar, with Sikandar Kher as his point man Daulat, are deliciously dark and together they create the swag and rot of Rajasthani royalty.
Namit Das as the coke-snorting Jawahar is manic, unpredictable, and Vikas Kumar as the earnest but annoying ACP Khan creates a character that will outlive the series.
 
Manish Choudhary as the Russians’ peddler-distributor Shekhawat, Vishwajeet Pradhan as his man Sampat, Sohaila Kapur as Zorawar's bitter, day-drinking wife Rajeshwari, and Maya Sarao as Maya all have a few big scenes and with each one they add muscle and moxie to the series.
 
Even the three kids — played by Virti Vaghani, Viren Vazirani and Pratyaksh Panwar — are measured, memorable.
Writers Sandeep Srivastav and Anu Singh Choudhary have embellished Sushmita’s character with items from her life, making it, in some ways, an extension of the actor’s own personality.
 
Apart from the hanging routine, there's rousing chanting of stanzas from the Gita, again a regular feature on Sushmita's Instagram.
Sushmita's character, which has been given an Eileen Fisher type of layered, minimalist but chic mommy wardrobe, keeps calling all her children “Bachcha”, instead of by their name.
A trait of a woman who is a natural caregiver, perhaps. But it’s jarring and sticks out as an affectation because of Sushmita's studied attempt at ""acting"",
Sushmita has powerful screen presence, but her dialogue delivery is the sort you hear in acting classes — rehearsed, deliberate, read out.
 
She's got everything going for her. All she needs now is a little fluidity and to shed some of her diva gold dust.

"New Delhi: Romanian writer-director Radu Jude’s Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn opens with a naughty, kinky pornographic scene. Emi (Katia Pascariu), a school teacher, is having sex with her husband and they are recording the proceedings for a bit of extra thrill.
But somehow the sex tape leaks and is soon making the rounds of giggly WhatsApp groups of her students and their parents. Some download it, purportedly as evidence to beat Emi with. The fact that the sex is consensual, between a husband and wife is irrelevant. There is outrage, and it's mostly about how could a middle-aged, married woman be so raunchy.
 
Radu Jude’s film, which uses this porn clip and the subsequent ""trial"" of Emi in the school’s yard to draw circles around a society's hypocrisy, won the Golden Bear award for Best Film at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Friday.
The film is split in three parts. In the first, Loony Porn walks with Emi as she visits her school principal, goes to a book store and a pharmacy. Shot during the Coronavirus pandemic, this segment has visuals of a city all masked up and wary of social interactions. But it's also a city busy consuming, enraging, eradicating the past.
 
We watch arguments and fights in a supermarket, with owners of big cars who block the sidewalk as a matter of their right. Each clash is an assertion of the entitlement of the rich and marginalisation of others.
The film’s second part is polyphonic and here, through commentary, archival footage, statistics, words, nudes in newspapers, building rising and in ruins, Loony Porn tells the story of Romania — about its role in the Holocaust, its attitude to Jews, Romas, love for dictators, attitude to sex and children. It also tells us that in Romania, 6 out of 10 kids are subjected to family violence.
 
This fact hovers over the film's last segment -- the meeting called by the school principal and parents to interrogate and then vote on Emi’s future. It is kicked off by a parent who insists on playing the sex clip for the benefit of all those gathered.
This scene, framed like an inquisition — the ""accused"" is in the middle, flanked by a judge who will rule based on the mood of the people and the enforcer of morality — is both dark and funny. Though allegations, tangential discussions, innuendoes, inappropriate remarks, shrill sanctimony and, finally, the judgment, Loony Porn lays bare a nation that has revised its history to legitimise its past and current criminal acts and feels emboldened to air its prejudice, bigotry and misplaced rage. Because many speak in the same tongue, collective hypocrisy gets elevated to a sanctimonious, narcissistic chorus.  
 
What's striking is how familiar it all feels. This searing portrait of a nation and its people could well be a day in the life of India.

"The women of today are focused, feisty and raring to go in pursuit of their true calling. And nothing seems to be holding them back. Because she knows exactly what she wants and is growing increasingly immune to petty criticism and stereotypical judgements.
In a fun chat, a bunch of women speak about the inanest comments that came their way when they chose to follow their heart. And what needs to change, as we celebrate another year of Women’s Day!
 
Don’t need sympathy
I am not a propagator of pushing or breaking the glass ceiling. We harp on and on about the fictional glass ceiling. In my opinion, we create our own reality by owning up to our actions. What glass ceiling are we talking about? It has always been a self-fulfilling prophecy. On one hand, we’re always talking about equality and on the other we expect praise for being a woman entrepreneur. Just like you have ‘a boss’ — not a woman boss or a male boss — you’re an entrepreneur, irrespective of gender. The term ‘woman entrepreneur’ is redundant. Your goals don’t know or care about your gender. Just keep going and rise through to where you ought to be.”
Ami Sata, Founder, Amouve
 
Be happy
One should follow their own soul’s calling. I’ve been told I was a dreamer, crazy, irresponsible and ungrounded just because I chose to do what made me happy. Women are questioned a lot more about their choices, and I really hope that changes. Most women today in my opinion are looking for freedom — and being able to do what you like is true freedom.”
Sheelaa Bajaj, Celebrity numerologist
No room for regression
A male acquaintance once said to me, out of the blue, ‘Honestly, Sanhita, I think you are trying too hard. You could have just put on some make-up, and dressed well and got married to a rich guy so that you don’t have to do anything and enjoy a luxurious life’.
I’ve often been asked when is my Chick Lit book coming out. This women’s day I wish we are inclusive of all genders when we make decisions. But above all, I wish that we are able to create a safe society which is more accepting of all kinds of people so that in the future we no longer need to celebrate a certain day to remind people of what more needs to be done to benefit us all.”
Sanhita Baruah,best-selling author of The Art of Letting Go in Amazon’s poetry category, 2020
 
Take charge of your life
I have heard many comments like ‘That’s interesting! What else do you do?’ Another regular comment is, ‘You must not be married. That’s why you are able to do all this. See how things change after marriage...’.
Truth is I’ve been married for 10 years now. My wish for every woman is to be able to take charge of their lives and be aware of their own capabilities, irrespective of people’s perceptions about them or what they do.”
Shambhavi Singh, (Runs Kaushalya.mantra, a wellness start-up, focuses on holistic health)
 
Freedom from bias
It’s high time people start to take fledgling women entrepreneurs seriously. I was once told that I could enjoy and have fun in life on the pretext of ‘entrepreneurship.’ These were their exact words, ‘No one will even question you. But if you are really serious, then let me tell you, building a sustainable business is not everyone’s cup of tea.’
So, from my experience, when women talk about wanting and finding freedom, it actually starts with the need for freedom against bias and stereotyping.”

"Paris: Tech giants love to portray themselves as forces for good and as the United States was gripped by anti-racism protests a number of them publicly disavowed selling controversial facial recognition technology to police forces.
Facial recognition has numerous applications that could simplify our lives as we’ve seen with Apple using it to unlock smartphones or in stores to replace cash registers.
 
But the technology has a dark side, with facial recognition integrated into China’s massive public surveillance system and its social credit experiment where even minor infractions of public norms can result in sanctions.
As the protests spread across the United States about police violence and racism, pressure mounted on tech firms about the technology. Microsoft and Amazon announced they would suspend sales of facial recognition software to police forces while IBM said it would exit the business.
Privacy and rights groups worry about the implications of the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement.
 
‘Extremely intrusive’ technology        
“It is an extremely intrusive form of surveillance and can seriously undermine our freedoms and eventually our society as a whole,” says Privacy International.
“The biggest danger is that this technology will be used for general, suspicionless surveillance systems,” says for its part the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
It notes that US state governments hold extensive photo databases as part of their motor vehicle departments, which if combined with public surveillance or other cameras, could result in “a comprehensive system of identification and tracking”.
 
In January 2020, a New York Times investigation pulled back the curtain on the activities of Californian startup Clearview AI, whose facial recognition tool “could end your ability to walk down the street anonymously”.
Social network photos scraped          
That is because Clearview AI doesn’t use photos held by governments, but billions of photos scraped from social media sites.
While social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube (Google) and LinkedIn (Microsoft) protested against the unsanctioned use of their users’ photos, Clearview hasn’t acceded to their demands to delete them.
 
The firm, which received funding from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, says it has already signed up 600 law enforcement agencies worldwide.
According to advocacy group AlgorithmWatch, at least 10 European police forces already use facial recognition technology and haven’t needed to turn to the tech giants.
“I have never seen a contract between Microsoft, Amazon or IBM and a police force in the investigations I have done on the subject,” said journalist Nicolas Kayser-Bril, who did the research behind the AlgorithmWatch report.
 
Technology already widely available              
“Tools for conducting facial recognition are widely available,” he added, noting that BriefCam, a subsidiary of Japanese multinational Canon which specialises in ultra-rapid analysis of images, is one of the leaders in the European market.
China has begun to export its facial recognition technology, particularly via its telecoms equipment giant Huawei.
A company executive told a business forum in Morocco last year that with its technology not only the identity of a person can be identified, but educational and work experience, personal preferences and recent travel.
 
In February, The Intercept cited a report that 10 European police forces are considering a joint network for facial recognition searches by extending agreements in place that allow sharing of biometric information like DNA and fingerprints.
France’s interior ministry is expected to unveil soon proposals to widen the use of the technology, with officials keen to be able to use in certain cases such as terrorist attacks and child kidnappings.

"Hyderabad: First there were the mice, and some rats. Then came Syrian hamsters and the rabbits. And finally there were the rhesus macaque monkeys. The lakhs of people receiving Covaxin to keep themselves safe from Covid-19, and to help stop the spread of the disease in India and elsewhere in the world, have much to thank these animals for.
Not just because these animals were the first ones to receive the jabs of the three vaccine candidates developed by scientists at the Bharat Biotech, along with Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).
 
Not just because the animals were deliberately injected with the SARS-CoV-2 to test the efficacy of the candidate vaccines while in their cages in a high security Level 4 biosafety hazard lab at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.
But because at the end of the study periods, each of them was put to sleep for ever before necropsies were performed on their bodies by the scientists who studied what the virus did to the animals and their organs, and how the vaccine candidates worked in controlling the virus in their bodies.
All these animals, unknown to anyone outside of the NIV lab or the scientists involved in the vaccine development — in human terms — made the ultimate sacrifice of giving up their lives so the very humans who put them through the trials, could keep themselves safe from the virus that probably racked their fragile bodies as the vaccines and the virus battled it out in their organs.
 
In three studies, scientists from Bharat Biotech, NIV and ICMR provide great detail about how the trial were conducted, and how the immune response for the candidate vaccines — three versions of the then under-development (during the peak of the lockdown in 2020) Bharat Biotech’s vaccine — was in these animals.
There is a reason why lab grown rats, mice, Syrian hamsters, and rabbits are chosen for the studies. As is also the case with the rhesus macaques. The manner in which the immune responses to a virus in these animals develop, is very close to how a human body responds to a virus. And therein lies the value of testing vaccine candidates on these animals even if it means injecting them with the virus to study how their bodies respond and how the vaccines work in controlling the virus in them.
 
Once the trial is over, even if it is possible to extract tissue samples from various organs without actually killing the animals, their subsequent upkeep and nursing them back to health is a hard task. Since these animals are bred for the express purpose of testing in labs, with the exception of the monkeys, and once the tests are completed they are of no further use for any other tests, they are put to sleep in the most humane way possible, according to a senior scientist well versed with the strict protocols that govern use of animals in labs for such tests.
 
While the rats, mice, rabbits and Syrian hamsters were lab-bred, the rhesus macaques that were used in testing Covaxin candidates were caught in the wild in Maharashtra.
According to the study on the tests conducted on the monkeys, permission from the Office of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Maharashtra state, was obtained for capturing 30 rhesus macaques from the wild. Because a decline in the macaque population was observed in the permitted areas of Maharashtra due to the habitat change “probably imposed by food scarcity during the Covid-19 lockdown period of India (March 25, 2020, till May 31, 2020),” 20 of them — 12 males and 8 females — “were captured using experienced monkey catchers,” the study reported. The research was conducted in compliance with the guidelines laid down by the Committee for the Purpose of Control And Supervision of Experiments on Animals, Government of India, the study said.

"New Delhi: Evil is beguiling, evil geniuses more so. They excite us like tantalising puzzles that we want to examine and solve.  
Writers, film directors, theatre owners and audiences are almost like law enforcement officers in their pursuit to understand psychopaths and that’s why they keep revisiting terrorists, serial killers, rapists -- for yet another peek into their minds, their homes, their rage, and their crimes.
 
But, psychopaths are also cliches.
Almost every exploration of a criminal mind that's been mounted on the big screen or split into episodes for OTT platforms is a trek down a familiar road. En route there are absentee or overbearing parents. Some physical or emotional abuse. There’s unease in mundane, social situations. Solace in solitude. And there’s almost, always, sexual frustration.
Given this template, there is nothing exceptional in the story of Theodore Kaczynski, or as he is better known, Ted Kaczynski, America’s Unabomber. And yet, writer-director Tony Stone’s film Ted K, which had its world premiere at the 71st International Film Festival of Berlin on Monday, stands out.
 
To tell the story of the Unabomber, Stone uses real television clips, Kaczynski’s writings, diary entries — which were copious and in numerical code — and meshes them with an intense, bravura performance by Sharlto Copley.
The South African actor, known for his performance as Wikus van der Merwe in the 2009 science fiction film District 9, carries Ted K with a meticulously studied but intense act that is as discomforting as it is impressive.
He remains in an unrelenting wired state throughout, whether he is raging against the whirring helicopters overhead, the pillage of the earth around him, building a bomb or complaining to a telephone company official about the $5 and few cents that a public phone owes him.
 
We watch, in his body and face, as his complexes, sense of superiority, frustration turn into a raging, mad desire to seek revenge on corporates, technology, one parcel bomb at a time.
Great performances, especially in biopics, are marked by that moment when the actor becomes the character, embodying and portraying all the ugliness and physicality while creating an inner cosmos that we can read in their eyes, in the tiniest change of expression.
Copley as Kaczynski, a mathematics prodigy who joined Harvard University at the age of 16 but then checked out to live by himself in Montana mountains in a 10-by-12 wood cabin, is on the screen throughout. Except for a few brief scenes in the 120-minute film, the camera stays on Copley and there is not a single false note in his compelling act.
 
Among the younger lot in Hollywood, Christian Bale, Leonado de Caprio, Matthew McConaughey, Javier Bardem, Joaquin Phoenix, James Franco and Bradley Cooper are names taken with reverence in terms of how much they give of themselves to a role.
Difficult films with demanding roles can ride on them.
To that hall of fame, Ted K adds the name of Sharlto Copley. He creates the sort of scary, uneasy portrait of a man in constant distress and rage that won’t ever leave you.

"Hyderabad: In the rapidly evolving field of healthcare protocols and advancements in treatments of various diseases and health conditions, two city doctors have been digging deep, down to the genetic information level, in a bid to ensure best possible outcomes for their patients.
“This is the next step in medical care,” says Dr Kalyan Uppuluri, from K&H Personalized Medicine Clinic. He, along with Dr Hima Challa, are the founders of the clinic, the first of its kind in the country to offer services bringing genomic medicine into clinical medicare. Armed with degrees in medical genomics from Stanford University and Harvard Medical School respectively, they say they took a leap of faith two years ago to set up their clinic in the city.
 
“There is enough data at the genetic level of humans to help modern medicine become more precise,” says Dr Hima Challa. “There is very strong objective evidence for this.”
The challenge for them was to translate molecular biology level data into medical language. A team of molecular biologists armed with advanced degrees dug deep into published research and after studying thousands of research papers, gathered data on around 8,000 genes and switched what each of them do and what that means in medical language. “For example, the gene that regulates glycogen provides information on how glucose is released when needed by the body. If there are disorders associated with this, this can be determined by genetic studies. If a person is prone to this problem, then advise can be given that he or she needs to consume carbohydrates before exercises or workouts so energy is available for these tasks,” Dr Hima Challa explained.
 
Genomic medicine helps in determining risk scores for various possible health conditions and these scores remain more or less stable through one’s life. Clinical risk scores can change, and can be changed for the better based on follow up advice from physicians, especially when coupled with knowledge of the genetic risk scores, she says.
“Our view is that personalized medicine is the future. Patients will be in a position, when their doctors have the assistance of genomic medicine, to be assured that they are in a position to achieve the best possible outcomes for their treatment,” says Dr Kalyan Uppuluri.
 
Medicines of the future will evolve based on genomics, he predicts. “We see this already in oncology, for treating cancers. Genomics is already helping in attacking this disease’s pathways,” he says.
On what the future holds, he says that they see their clinic offering their products based on algorithms developed based on genetic information they have complied as well as from their patients so far, to support clinics and hospitals. If clinical medicine is combined with genomic medicine and with proper follow-ups by patients, the treatment outcomes will be much better, help patients overcome their disease and help their doctors prescribe protocols that can better combat their conditions, he says.

"Hyderabad: A recently launched biography of the late N.T. Rama Rao, titled 'Maverick Messaiah', written by journalist Ramesh Kandula, chronicles and analyses the political life of NTR and its impact on both the state and the nation. An objective assessment of the late leader, the book has been well-received for its critical insight and diligent research.
What set NTR apart from later day movie stars entering politics? Is the Telugu Desam a Kamma party meant to empower the community and is it dying? In this two-part interview with Sriram Karri, author Kandula defends the party and explains what set NTR apart.
 
Why did NTR remain the last real actor phenomenon to achieve political success? Tamil superstar Rajanikant has now announced he won’t enter politics, while Chiranjeevi and Pawan Kalyan had great fan networks but could not convert them into political parties that could debut with electoral wins.
Film actors who entered politics in the past, especially M.G. Ramachandran (MGR) and later on, N.T. Rama Rao (NTR), had a strong artistic urge to connect with the people. The social bonding they enjoyed with their audiences was qualitatively different from actors who strayed into politics in recent years. Despite enormous adulation they enjoyed, neither MGR nor NTR took the people for granted when entering politics. Unlike MGR, NTR did not have a political pedigree, but spared no effort in understanding and articulating public issues that impacted the masses.
 
Chiranjeevi enjoyed many advantages but failed to convince the voting public that he was an alternative to the existing set-up. His campaign began with an assumption that he was a chief-minister-in-waiting and he had to just walk through elections to occupy the chair.
While NTR used his celluloid image to reach out to the public, he never relied on his glamour alone. The political content of NTR’s campaign was more focused and serious, while Chiranjeevi’s was more style than substance. I think Pawan Kalyan also suffers from the same failings (as his brother). Actors cannot succeed in politics unless they carry a serious political message.
 
Did the kind of films NTR played, particularly mythologies, give him any advantage? Why did he have such high credibility with masses? What in your estimate justifies calling him a messiah of any kind, even if of a maverick kind?
An interesting aspect of NTR's mythologies were that they were pan-Indian stories, and not directly related to Telugu nationalism and pride that NTR propounded politically. During NTR’s time, screen adaptations of mythologies became known for a distinctive Telugu, which was formal and ceremonial. As several researchers have pointed out, NTR's mastery over language, considered a quintessential Telugu experience, did help in his emergence as a Telugu cultural symbol.
 
My hypothesis is that NTR carried over the linguistic identity of these films into his political campaign, but not his screen 'divinity'. His political credibility was not a by-product of his playing godly characters. He worked towards it consciously both in his film career and later on in politics.
As for the tag of messiah, NTR burst on to the political scene in 1982 as a ray of hope and captivated the imagination of the Telugus like no other leader. His campaigns were the greatest spectacles of democracy in action. Shortcomings notwithstanding, NTR emerged as a larger-than-life personality and brought a sea-change in the socio-political landscape of AP.
 
The maverick apart, NTR was a man of strange contradictions. He believed in the power of people, but his democratic credentials were suspect because he had no qualms in turning his party into a one-man show. He was secular to the core but exhibited a peculiar religious streak. He entered politics on the plank of regionalism but remained a committed nationalist throughout.
How did people relate to his dramatics and eccentricities?
His dramatics entertained the masses but some sections of people intensely disliked the theatrics he brought into politics. He carried this urge to be the centre of attraction from reel to public life. However, common folks were not particularly put off by this, because of his ability to convey seriousness of intent. Despite the nickname 'Drama Rao', NTR was a very serious man in private and rarely cracked a joke. But a common person felt warmth in his presence.

"New Delhi: Most mobile applications that track the spread of COVID-19 require access to users’ personal data, but only a handful indicate the data would be anonymous, encrypted and secured, according to a study by Indian-origin researchers in the US.
Professor Masooda Bashir and doctoral student Tanusree Sharma from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign analysed 50 COVID-19-related apps available in the Google Play store for their access to users’ personal data and their privacy protections.
 
The researchers noted that it is disconcerting that these apps are continuously collecting and processing highly sensitive and personally identifiable information, about health, location and direct identifiers like name, age, email address and voter or national identification of a user.
“Governments’ use of such tracking technology—and the possibilities for how they might use it after the pandemic—is chilling to many,” the researchers wrote in the study published in the journal Nature Medicine.
“Notably, surveillance mapping through apps will allow governments to identify people’s travel paths and their entire social networks,” they noted.
 
The researchers explained that functionalities of the COVID-related apps developed around the world include live maps and updates of confirmed cases, real-time location-based alerts, systems for monitoring home isolation and quarantine, direct reporting to the government of symptoms, and education about COVID-19.
Some also offer monitoring of vital signs, virtual medical consultations and community-driven contact tracing, the said.
Of the 50 apps the researchers evaluated, 30 require users’ permission to access data from their mobile devices such as contacts, photos, media, files, location data, the camera.
 
These 30 apps also require the device’s ID, call information, Wi-Fi connection, microphone, network access, the Google service configuration, and the ability to change network connectivity and audio settings, according to the study.
Some of the apps, the researchers said, state they will collect users’ age, email address, phone number and postal code; the device’s location, unique identifiers, mobile IP address and operating system; and the types of browsers used on the device.
Only 16 of the apps indicated such data will be anonymous, encrypted, secured and reported only in aggregate form, they said.
 
Of the apps sampled in the study, 20 were issued by governments, health ministries and other such official sources.
The researchers acknowledged that mass surveillance measures may be necessary to contain the spread of the virus.
“Health care providers must absolutely use whatever means are available to save lives and confine the spread of the virus,” they wrote in the journal.
However, the researchers added that it is up to the rest, especially those in the field of information privacy and security, to ask the questions needed to protect the right to privacy.

The researchers explained that functionalities of the COVID-related apps developed around the world include live maps and updates of confirmed cases, real-time location-based alerts, systems for monitoring home isolation and quarantine, direct reporting to the government of symptoms, and education about COVID-19.
Some also offer monitoring of vital signs, virtual medical consultations and community-driven contact tracing, the said.
Of the 50 apps the researchers evaluated, 30 require users’ permission to access data from their mobile devices such as contacts, photos, media, files, location data, the camera.
 
These 30 apps also require the device’s ID, call information, Wi-Fi connection, microphone, network access, the Google service configuration, and the ability to change network connectivity and audio settings, according to the study.
Some of the apps, the researchers said, state they will collect users’ age, email address, phone number and postal code; the device’s location, unique identifiers, mobile IP address and operating system; and the types of browsers used on the device.
Only 16 of the apps indicated such data will be anonymous, encrypted, secured and reported only in aggregate form, they said.
 
Of the apps sampled in the study, 20 were issued by governments, health ministries and other such official sources.
The researchers acknowledged that mass surveillance measures may be necessary to contain the spread of the virus.
“Health care providers must absolutely use whatever means are available to save lives and confine the spread of the virus,” they wrote in the journal.
However, the researchers added that it is up to the rest, especially those in the field of information privacy and security, to ask the questions needed to protect the right to privacy.

"San Francisco: Snapchat on Wednesday became the latest social network moving to curb the reach of US President Donald Trump, claiming the president has been inciting “racial violence.”
The youth-focused social network said it would no longer promote Trump on its Discover platform for recommended content.
 
“We will not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice by giving them free promotion on Discover,” a statement from Snapchat said.
The move came days after Twitter took an unprecedented stand by hiding a Trump post it said promoted violence, heating up the White House war with Silicon Valley and social media.
Snapchat parent Snap chief executive Evan Spiegel over the weekend sent a lengthy memo to employees condemning what he saw as a legacy of racial injustice and violence in the US.
Snapchat will not promote accounts in the US that are linked to people who incite racial violence on or off the messaging platform, according Spiegel.
 
“Every minute we are silent in the face of evil and wrongdoing we are acting in support of evildoers,” Spiegel wrote as companies responded to the outrage over the police killing of a black man in Minnesota.
“I am heartbroken and enraged by the treatment of black people and people of color in America.”
The Discover feature at Snapchat is a curated platform on which the California-based company gets to decide what it recommends to users.
No longer recommended         
Trump’s account remains on the platform, it will just no longer be recommended viewing, according to Snapchat.
 
“We will make it clear with our actions that there is no gray area when it comes to racism, violence, and injustice—and we will not promote it, nor those who support it, on our platform,” Spiegel said in the memo.
Snapchat is particularly popular with young internet users, claiming that about half of the US “Generation Z” population tapping into news through its Discover feature.
“There are plenty of debates to be had about the future of our country and the world,” Spiegel said.
“But there is simply no room for debate in our country about the value of human life and the importance of a constant struggle for freedom, equality, and justice.”
 
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale denounced the move, claiming that “Snapchat is trying to rig the 2020 election, illegally using their corporate funding to promote Joe Biden and suppress President Trump.”
Parscale said in a statement: “Snapchat hates that so many of their users watch the president’s content and so they are actively engaging in voter suppression... If you’re a conservative, they do not want to hear from you, they do not want you to vote. They view you as a deplorable and they do not want you to exist on their platform.”
 
Facebook looks away               
The move by Twitter last week prompted an angry response by Trump, who within days signed an executive order calling for heightened government oversight of social platforms.
Trump accuses the platforms of “censorship” and limiting “free speech,” but his critics say the president has distorted the interpretation of those terms and is himself seeking to regulate online content.
In contrast to Twitter and Snapchat, Facebook has defended his decision not to interfere with posts by Trump.
 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated his position in a call with employees this week, according to reports, despite criticism of the Facebook policy by civil rights activists.
The coronavirus pandemic has put an abrupt stop to traditional US political means of courting young voters—forcing presidential candidates to turn to Snapchat instead.
The photo-sending app that boasts 229 million users—better known for filters that turn your face into a puppy or a vampire—is a new battlefield for opponents Trump and Biden, both of whom are in their 70s.
 
Last month, Ken Farnaso, the Trump campaign deputy press secretary, told AFP that Snapchat was an important element of the re-election effort and that the Republican was ahead of Biden on the platform.
“It’s clear that we’re wiping the floor with Biden’s campaign,” Farnaso said of the Snapchat effort.

"New York: A tech-focused civil liberties group on Tuesday sued to block President Donald Trump’s executive order that seeks to regulate social media, saying it violates the First Amendment and puts curbs on free speech.
Trump’s order, signed last week, could allow more lawsuits against internet companies like Twitter and Facebook for what their users post, tweet and stream.
 
The order was more political than substantive, with many experts questioning whether it was constitutional. The president aimed to rally his supporters after Twitter put fact checks on two of his tweets. Trump, without evidence, has long accused tech companies of being biased against conservatives.
The order targets current law — you may have heard recent references to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — that protects internet companies from lawsuits. They can’t be sued for hosting videos and posts from users, or for moderating their services, with some exceptions.
 
In its suit, the Center for Democracy and Technology said that Trump’s executive order violates the First Amendment because it attacks Twitter for putting the fact checks on the president’s tweets, which CDT said is Twitter’s right as a private company. More broadly, the order is trying to curb speech of all online platforms and people “by demonstrating the willingness to use government authority to retaliate against those who criticize the government,” CDT said.
“The government cannot and should not force online intermediaries into moderating speech according to the president’s whims,” said Alexandra Givens, CDT’s CEO, in an emailed statement. The organization filed the federal suit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.
 
There was pushback against Trump’s order from various sources. Tech industry groups, unsurprisingly, said it was bad for innovation and speech. Civil rights and libertarian organizations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also criticized Trump’s order.

"New Delhi: Getting unwarranted video call requests at odd hours and comments on social media photos by male colleagues who are not friends are among issues of sexual harassment women working from home during the nationwide lockdown have faced, organisations working against cyber harassment said.
The coronavirus-triggered lockdown has posed a lot of challenges for women professionals especially, as they struggle to manage the work-life balance. In addition, they are also facing sexual harassment online.
 
Many women have approached experts for guidance, unsure of how to raise complaints of sexual harassment in the work-from-home scenario.
“There are no clear guidelines from companies on how work from home should function in an organisation and that confuses women. I have been receiving 4-5 such complaints of harassment everyday ever since the lockdown was imposed,” said Akancha Srivastava, who runs the foundation Akancha Against Harassment, an initiative against cyber harassment.
However, the number of complaints received by the National Commission for Women (NCW) has been low since the lockdown began but those working in the field say that could be because many women do not want to officially complain but wish to consult what they can do on the matter.
 
“During the lockdown, many women are worried about their job security so they are not sure if they should speak up or not. The women have a constant worry that they should not be seen as troublemakers,” Srivastava said.
 “Since we have never experienced absolute work from home before, women are always second-guessing if it was harassment, where does one draw the line, how does one define the body language as offensive or indecent? Male colleagues stalking them on social media or sending friend requests, commenting on their pictures when they are not even friends.
 
“Women are being told to come online at odd hours. These are subtle ways of sexually harassing them,” she said.
Giving examples, Srivastava said one woman had recently received a video call request from her boss at 11 pm for an “urgent matter”, but when she received the call it turned out to be for something that on a regular day would have been easily taken care of over an email.
Srivastava said that with work-from-home, there are bound to be some disruptions and that colleagues should respectfully accept them, but that is not happening. That is causing more stress to women.
 
For example, in a sexist comment, another woman was asked by her boss over video call if she was capable of handling work assigned to her as she seemed “distracted” because of her children who were playing in the background.
Some women have also complained that they find their colleagues inappropriately dressed during virtual meetings and it made them uncomfortable.
The Prohibition of Sexual Harassment Act 2013 (or POSH) was enacted to ensure safe working spaces for women and to build enabling work environments that respect the rights of working women to equality of status and opportunity.
 
It defined a ‘workplace’ as “any place visited by employee arising out of or during the course of employment, including transportation provided by the employer for undertaking such a journey”. As such, while working from home, the home can also be defined as the workplace.
An activist at InfoSec Girls, an organisation educating women on cyber security, said a lot of people don’t report but wish to discuss what they should do when they face sexual harassment.
The activist said there have been times when men either do not realise that women colleagues are also on the call or choose to wilfully ignore it, while passing inappropriate comments.
 
Also, now that everyone is working from home, colleagues have lost sense of propriety about when a female colleague can be contacted. People end calling anytime and begin meetings at odd times. This can make women uncomfortable as they have to balance family life with work, she said.
“When women raise these kinds of concerns, we say, ‘if you feel uncomfortable with any discussion or comment, raise the concern immediately on the call so it does not happen again. If that makes them uncomfortable, then discuss it with the leadership or raise it via the organisation reporting channel’,” she said.
 
Every organisation is supposed to follow the Visakha guidelines on sexual harassment. “There is a proper council that addresses all these concerns. Women can anonymously report the concerns. The council then discusses the concern with person against whom the complaint was raised. If nothing else works out, women can report to local authorities,” she said.

"Tipplers in the five southern states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are eagerly awaiting the home delivery of alcohol as Zomato and Swiggy expanded the services launched in Jharkhand last week to Odisha today.
Less than a week after putting ‘wine shops’ in Jharkhand on its platform, Zomato expanded to Bhubaneswar and will soon deliver to other cities such as Rourkela, Balasore, Balangir, Sambalpur, Berhampur and Cuttack. Swiggy said it was starting with Bhubaneswar and Rourkela and would soon serve Cuttack and Berhampur as well.
 
The southward direction that the alcohol delivery services of the apps have taken bring hope to drinkers in the five southern states. While liquor outlets have opened in most places in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Kerala is still holding out.
The state, whose largest source of revenue is alcohol sales, has exercised restraint in opening up its state-owned Beverages Corporation (Bevco) outlets, cautious about triggering a setback to its successfully continuing fight against COVID-19, as people would inevitably crowd the wine shops.
 
To get around the problem, Kerala is launching its own Bevco app called Bev Q. Unlike Swiggy and Zomato that offer home delivery, Bev Q is a mobile virtual queue management app, which will enable the state to reopen liquor outlets while getting the public to adhere to physical distancing norms.
It has even passed the Google test, reports said, paving the way for the app to be listed for download on the Android Play Store.
Nevertheless tipplers would like the option of Swiggy and Zomato home delivery.
How a country coy about liquor allowed home delivery
 
After liquor shops across the country were shut down when the lockdown began on March 25,  as the restrictions were eased recently, the Supreme Court asked states to consider non-direct contact or online sales and home delivery of liquor during the lockdown period to prevent the spread of coronavirus on account of crowding at the shops.
Zomato and Swiggy, which already have a food delivery network in place across the country, then worked with state excise departments to work out the modalities of home delivery. To ensure compliance with safety guidelines as well as the laws on alcohol consumption, the two platforms verify the identity of the buyers to confirm they are not underage.
 
Users are required to upload a valid ID proof to order on the apps, which are later verified by delivery executives at the time of handing over the order. There would also be limits on how many bottles can be purchased, Zomato said.
Swiggy said it was partnering with authorised retailers after validating their licence and other required documents as outlined by the state government. It is also going one step further by getting customers to upload not just valid government ID but also a selfie, which the platform will use for authentication.
 
The company has partnered with HyperVerge to enable AI-face recognition for mandatory age verification and user authentication for alcohol deliveries, it said.

"When actor and director Olivia Wilde, best known for her role in the TV series House, was snapped holding hands with singer Harry Styles, who is 10 years her junior, one fan tweeted, “If she has kids at home, but is out running around with a dude a decade younger during a pandemic, she belongs to the streets (sic).”
Such vitriol against the mother, who found a date during the pandemic! Another user on the microblogging site wrote, “should be taking care of her two kids instead of dating one (sic)”.
Apparently, women are all on notice — if you give birth to a child and are single, you must say goodbye to your physical needs. What’s worse, the keep-it-in-your-pants attitude has existed across all strata of society—celebs, women from emancipated homes, and you-name-it.
Pooja Srinivasaraja, director of a global food chain, points out how women are expected to adhere to many rules that somehow seem to place them in a moral compass. “Being pious and not expressing passion post a child is so culturally engrained in us. If a mother was to be single, her looking for love or a companion is almost scorned upon,” she spells out.
The double standards
However, unlike Olivia Wilde, who had to endure unsolicited moral instructions and condemnation from strangers on Twitter about her sexual affiliations, men are usually praised for their sexual desires. And that’s what advocate Malini says is the flaw in our thinking. “If men stray even while in a marriage, the world attributes it to his success, stress and even an incompatible wife. His friends too look up to him as being a talent of sorts. But when a woman who is separated but has kids even dares to look for love, not necessarily marriage, even her own pals can be judgmental,” she states.
As early as 1975, when Australian activist Anne Summers did a seminal feminism-oriented book, titled Damned Whores and God’s Police, it became an unexpected bestseller, selling more than 100,000 copies. The book makes an observation that the absence of a culture embracing women as being anything other than either devoted mothers or “bad girls” was the “major impediment to female rebellion, and that which keeps women physically and psychologically bound to their family-centered roles”.
Sexual suppositions
Even as recently as five years ago, reality star Kim Kardashian, mother to four children, was unscrupulously attacked for appearing nude on the cover of Paper magazine. “I normally don’t. But … you’re someone’s mother,” wrote the late actress Naya Rivera who died by drowning in July 2020. However, and perhaps thankfully, that remark found its share of critics too. For one, Rachel Khona, of the popular parenting blog Scary Mommy and writer for several publications including The New York Times, The Washington Post, Playboy, Penthouse, Maxim, and Cosmopolitan, hit back. “Are moms supposed to suddenly metamorphosis after they have a child? We should respect women’s sexuality the same way we do men’s,” she wrote.
Even US-based transgender icon Laverne Cox agrees that society can be rather judgmental towards women. “When a woman dates younger men, and especially if you’re a mother they’d say, ‘Maybe you should be spending some time with your children.’ Why can’t a single mum leave her kids to the father to attend to while she also looks to satiate her needs?” she points out.
Your passion, your choice
Professor Dr Saranya Jai, a specialist in gender and sexual studies, isn’t surprised that mothers are still facing this censorship and prejudice. “These conversations about sexuality and consent are essential and important, and the ability for women to be able to choose to do what they want with their own body, and have sexual lives that are not only to reproduce,” adds Dr Saranya.
“Just as racism exists, sexism will exist. We need more women to find their voices and be bold about their choices. Conviction and courage will do the trick. We needn’t be apologetic about wanting to lead fulfilling lives. Kids or otherwise, we have a right to our own happiness.”
— Raena Reddy, a feminist
“When a woman dates a man, and especially if you’re a mother they’d say, ‘Maybe you should be spending some time with your children.’ Why is the onus always on the mother to nurture? Why can’t a single mum leave her kids to the father to attend to while she also looks to satiate her needs?”

"Weeks after Mukesh Ambani signed a deal between JioMart and Facebook, the self-declared kirana store aggregator has launched its services in 200 cities, including small cities such as Bhatinda, Mysuru and Dehradun, but without taking the neighbourhood stores on board.
A pilot project launched last month in Navi Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan, all suburbs of Mumbai, included kirana stores as well as JioMart’s own warehouses; but now with the national launch, the kirana stores are nowhere in the picture at present.
 
Currently, grocery orders placed on the JioMart website are serviced by Reliance Smart and Fresh stores and Reliance Retail’s Sahakari Bhandar stores, not neighbourhood shops, PTI quoted the financial services company Credit Suisse as saying.
“Just prior to the national launch, Reliance Retail tapped the WhatsApp customer base in the three pilot regions to source orders. In our view, it was just a test phase of integration,” it said.
""The orders were available only for pick-up from nearby kirana stores, whose details were sent to the customer via WhatsApp. However, the national launch, so far, does not have that integration with WhatsApp.”
 
While JioMart claims it will be adding kirana stores shortly on its platform, the question arises whether this is just a test phase to see whether customers will flock to JioMart abandoning their neighbourhood stores.
Even if that is not the case or in the event that the test is not successful and the kirana stores just have to be brought on board, Reliance could use them as mere delivery mules, insisting that the stores stock what Reliance supplies, at the rate it decides.
In an indication of that, Credit Suisse said, “In terms of pricing, Reliance has extended the Smart promise of ‘minimum 5 per cent off on MRP’ to all products on JioMart. The discount is higher on its private label brands, and is competitive to branded products.”
 
So, if it looks like the kirana store aggregator model of JioMart is morphing into a takeover of the grocery market itself, it could very well be the case. Market research firm Bernstein says groceries make up 70 per cent of the Indian retail market, with more than 90 per cent driven by neighbourhood shops. “Organised penetration is less than 10 per cent while online penetration is less than 1 per cent,” it said.
So Reliance’s likely ambition to replace mom and pop stores is pretty much in keeping with what seems to be its monopolistic vision. Case in point, the telecom industry, where Reliance’s free offers and low prices managed to make it the dominant force in a field that earlier had several players.
 
As things stand, supermarket chain D-Mart’s April revenues are down 45 per cent year-on-year, with nearly 50 per cent of its stores shut or having restricted hours of operation. D-Mart is just one example among a vast space being vacated by similar businesses in the grocery market.
These falling revenues are what Reliance aims to mop up with the JioMart network.
“...a pan-India extension of partnerships with mom and pop stores after a successful beta test and ramp-up of this new commerce venture is crucial in Reliance’s grand plan of converting Jio’s 400 million-plus subscribers into customers for its ecommerce and other offerings,” market investment and insights firm CLSA was quoted as saying by PTI.
 
As such, Reliance’s recent partnership with Facebook-owned WhatsApp for JioMart is aimed at converting Jio subscribers into JioMart shoppers.
Eventually, like other online retailers, Reliance could integrate its entire retail offerings, including fashion, lifestyle and consumer electronics, onto one super ecommerce platform and mobile app, rivalling Amazon and Flipkart.
Bernstein in a separate report said as much: “JioMart has seen a 4x rise in online orders from a low base. With its pan India presence, JioMart now directly competes with Amazon and Flipkart in eCommerce.”

"Hyderabad: The past few weeks saw various rare astronomical events, the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction, the triple conjunction of Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn, the Moon passing Mars- but astronomy enthusiasts in the city say that it is no more a thrill to witness these space events, because of the city lights.
Light pollution is a menace in the city of Hyderabad which is killing the joy of looking up to the night sky, astronomy enthusiasts and scientists have complained. Praveen Suryavanshi, an amateur astronomer and educator said that just to witness a full dark sky, one now will have to travel as far as at least a 100 kms away from the city. 
 
""I and my friends from the astronomers society in the city witnessed the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction from our offices and homes respectively. I was in Hi-Tech city that day, and in the shots I managed to get from the event show the kind of pollution from city lights and even the dust that emcompasses the sky now"", said Praveen. He added that the big flood lights, the neon lights on billboards and malls till the Shamshabad area have added to the mess, especially in the last four to five years. ""These unnecessary lights and the continuous construction activities have spoiled the city skies so much that even the night sky reflects this light, and on most nights clouds are visible"", he said.  
 
Dr. BG Sidharth, Director of the Birla Planetarium said that the first observatory near the city at Rangapur, 65 kms from the city, has also been affected by the light pollution. ""Unless one is very far away, on a hill or mountain, practicing astronomy in today's time is difficult, which is why the astronomy community here is growing weaker"", he said. 
The Japal-Rangapur Observatory under Osmania University open for research and practical work for post-graduate and Ph.D students, as well as for the public, has had the effects of civilisation in the nearby villages, but still has its nights of clear skies, argued Dr. Shanti Priya, Head, Department of Astronomy, OU. However, she agreed that the kind of dark sky experience a few years ago, is something that this generation will never be able to get. 
 
""We have held observation classes in the past few weeks for the conjunction occurrences among other events, for our 40-50 PG and research students. The LED lights around have had an effect on the observatory, but if the government takes some measures to increase the scientific temper while keeping in view the convenience of people around, like installing LED light covers, it will solve the issue to a great extent"", said Dr. Shanti Priya.
According to the world light pollution map, the location of the Rangapur Observatory falls in a rural/suburban transition sky, where the galaxy M33 in Triangulum, a key indicator of sky conditions visible to the eye is difficult to see. Here in the city, the location of the Birla Science Center Observatory is one of the highest light polluted areas anywhere in the world, making it impossible to locate the M33 galaxy in the city sky. 
 
Astronomers in the city now demand that government must take steps to protect the few dark skies left in and around the city like the Kotpally Reservoir area near Ananthagiri Hills, the Pocharam Dam in Medak, the Pakhal lake near Warangal, the Laknavaram Lake area, among others, by making strict policies to restrict urbanisation and declare these spots as Natural Dark Sky Sites.
Amateur astronomers have also brought to light an Archeoastronomy Megalithic site, similar to the Stonehenge 200 kms from Hyderabad, which falls under the village of Mudumal in Mahabubnagar district, where dark skies can be witnessed clearly. They demand that these sites should be preserved and protected for astronomy enthusiasts.

"Weeks after Mukesh Ambani signed a deal between JioMart and Facebook, the self-declared kirana store aggregator has launched its services in 200 cities, including small cities such as Bhatinda, Mysuru and Dehradun, but without taking the neighbourhood stores on board.
A pilot project launched last month in Navi Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan, all suburbs of Mumbai, included kirana stores as well as JioMart’s own warehouses; but now with the national launch, the kirana stores are nowhere in the picture at present.
 
Currently, grocery orders placed on the JioMart website are serviced by Reliance Smart and Fresh stores and Reliance Retail’s Sahakari Bhandar stores, not neighbourhood shops, PTI quoted the financial services company Credit Suisse as saying.
“Just prior to the national launch, Reliance Retail tapped the WhatsApp customer base in the three pilot regions to source orders. In our view, it was just a test phase of integration,” it said.
""The orders were available only for pick-up from nearby kirana stores, whose details were sent to the customer via WhatsApp. However, the national launch, so far, does not have that integration with WhatsApp.”
 
While JioMart claims it will be adding kirana stores shortly on its platform, the question arises whether this is just a test phase to see whether customers will flock to JioMart abandoning their neighbourhood stores.
Even if that is not the case or in the event that the test is not successful and the kirana stores just have to be brought on board, Reliance could use them as mere delivery mules, insisting that the stores stock what Reliance supplies, at the rate it decides.
In an indication of that, Credit Suisse said, “In terms of pricing, Reliance has extended the Smart promise of ‘minimum 5 per cent off on MRP’ to all products on JioMart. The discount is higher on its private label brands, and is competitive to branded products.”
 
So, if it looks like the kirana store aggregator model of JioMart is morphing into a takeover of the grocery market itself, it could very well be the case. Market research firm Bernstein says groceries make up 70 per cent of the Indian retail market, with more than 90 per cent driven by neighbourhood shops. “Organised penetration is less than 10 per cent while online penetration is less than 1 per cent,” it said.
So Reliance’s likely ambition to replace mom and pop stores is pretty much in keeping with what seems to be its monopolistic vision. Case in point, the telecom industry, where Reliance’s free offers and low prices managed to make it the dominant force in a field that earlier had several players.
 
As things stand, supermarket chain D-Mart’s April revenues are down 45 per cent year-on-year, with nearly 50 per cent of its stores shut or having restricted hours of operation. D-Mart is just one example among a vast space being vacated by similar businesses in the grocery market.
These falling revenues are what Reliance aims to mop up with the JioMart network.

"New York: The role of technology in helping push back against the novel coronavirus has been hailed widely. But it also means that people are constantly being watched by entities that can set the tone for public behaviour without giving a shred of consideration to people’s privacy. One of the greatest contemporary thinkers, Noam Chomsky, warns of the consequences of technology being allowed to control our lives in the guise of making our lives easier.
In an interview with AFP, Chomsky talked about how the dystopian reality of digital surveillance is already here.  “There are now companies developing technology which make it possible for the employer ... to look at what's on your computer screen and to check your keystrokes and if you get up and walk away for a minute, they'll send you a warning.”
 
“That's being installed right now.... It's not the future.”
The very things that are convenient are the ones that are invasive, he pointed out. “The so-called Internet of Things is coming along. It's convenient. It means if you're driving home you can turn on the stove — but it also means that that information is going to Google and Facebook, to the government, the American government, the French government, it's an enormous amount of potential control, surveillance and invasion. But this has happened. It's not the future.
 
“If we allow the huge tech companies, the state, to control our life that's what will happen. They'll turn it into something like China, where you have social credit systems and in some cities you get a certain amount of credits, there's face recognition technology all over the place and everything you do gets monitored.
“If you cross the street in the wrong place, you can ... lose some credits, and so on.
“It's not inevitable, just like global warming, that it's going to happen — unless people stop it.”
 
When asked whether the use of surveillance was justified in combating COVID-19, said “It might be — during the period of threat. There's controls needed during wartime, you have rationing. But it doesn't have to be permanent.... 'Yes, we'll let you have this authority now, but it can be revoked at any time.'""
Speaking about other major problems facing humankind, Chomsky said global warming was a greater threat than even the deadly pandemic. . “As severe as this pandemic is, it's not the worst problem. There will be recovery from the pandemic at severe cost ... but there isn't going to be any recovery from the melting of the polar ice caps and the rising of sea levels and the other deleterious effects of global warming,” he said.
 
However, it is evident that the public is either not aware or not bothered to see global warming as a serious enough problem.  
That kind of a public in the US also voted for a leadership that has proven itself wholly unequal to the task of managing the pandemic in the country where more than 100,000 people have died of it . “There's no coherent leadership. It's chaotic. The presidency, the White House, is in the hands of a sociopathic megalomaniac who's interested in nothing but his own power, electoral prospects — doesn't care what happens to the country, the world,” Chomsky said, in scathing criticism of President Donald Trump.
 
Chomsky spelled out how the administration under Trump never even gave the US a chance against COVID-19. “As soon as Trump came in, his first move was to dismantle the entire pandemic prevention machinery. At the start, defunding the Center for Disease Control, which would deal with this. And canceling programs that were working with Chinese scientists to identify potential viruses. So the US was singularly unprepared,” Chomsky said.
He explained the economic model that led to the current situation. “It's a privatised society, very wealthy, with enormous advantages — far more than any other country — but it’s in the stranglehold of private control.
 
“It doesn't have a universal health care system.... It's the ultimate neoliberal system, actually.”
He compared it to Europe, which in “many ways is worse, because the austerity programs just amplify the danger, because of the severe attack on democracy in Europe, the shifting decisions to Brussels....” But he added, “At least it has the residue of some kind of social democratic structure, which provides some support, which is what I think is lacking in the US.”

"WASHINGTON: @realDonaldTrump, the Twitter feed that grew from the random musings of a reality TV star into the cudgel of an American president, has died. It was not quite 12 years old.
The provocative handle was given birth by a New York real estate tycoon who used it to help him become the 45th U.S. president. It began with a May 4, 2009, tweet promoting Donald Trump’s upcoming appearance on David Letterman’s show.
 
It died more than 57,000 tweets later, with Trump using some of his final postings on the powerful platform to commiserate with a pro-Trump mob that besieged the halls of Congress in a deadly assault as lawmakers were set to certify his defeat.
The account met its demise when Twitter announced Friday it was pulling the plug permanently on @realDonaldTrump, citing concern that Trump would use it for “further incitement of violence.” Trump retorted that he’d be “building out our own platform in the near future. We will not be SILENCED!”
 
Trump, a novice politician but seasoned salesman, realized the power of social media in ways that few other politicians did. And he wielded it with never-before-seen power to diminish his opponents, shape elections and mold reality — at least in the eyes of his supporters.
Early on, @realDonaldTrump seemed innocent enough. Its owner, who had prolific experience in marketing casinos, real estate and even Oreos, used the platform mostly to promote his books, media appearances and give friendly plugs to friends.
But as Trump began seriously toying with a White House run, it became a tool to scorch opponents and give shape to his nationalist, “America First” philosophy.
 
He deployed its venom equally, whether insulting celebrity enemies (Rosie O’Donnell was “crude, rude, obnoxious and dumb”) or or using xenophobia to malign a country (Britain is “trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem”).
Peter Costanzo, then an online marketing director for the publishing company putting out Trump’s book, “Think Like a Champion,” helped bring Trump to the platform.
Twitter was still in its infancy at the time. But Costanzo, who later came to work for The Associated Press, saw the then-140-character-per-message platform as a new tool that the real estate mogul could use to boost sales and reach a broader audience.
 
Costanzo was given seven minutes to make his pitch to Trump — “Not five minutes, not 10,” he recalled in a 2016 interview.
Trump liked what he heard.
“I said, ‘Let’s call you @realDonaldTrump — you’re the real Donald Trump,’” recalled Costanzo. “He thought about it for a minute and said: ‘I like it. Let’s do it.’”
Other than Trump’s family, no one seemed off-limits from his Twitter wrath. Trump attacked Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats, 2016 political rivals, current administration staffers, former administration staffers, the Republican Party and cable networks.
 
@realDonaldTrump was prolific: On days when its owner was particularly agitated, such as in the midst of impeachment proceedings, it pushed out more than 100 tweets.
In its most popular tweet, on Oct. 2, 2020, @realDonaldTrump announced that Trump and first lady Melania Trump had contracted the coronavirus. The post got 1.8 million likes and nearly 400,000 retweets, according to Factba.se., which tracks the president’s social media habits and commentary.
The account was used to announce firings. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson learned of his ouster in a tweet.
 
The account threatened adversaries in the most colorful terms. Before Trump “fell in love” with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un through secretly exchanged letters, Trump used Twitter to dub him “rocket man” and vowed to respond with “fire and fury” if the authoritarian dared attack the United States.
@realDonaldTrump frequently spread misleading, false and malicious assertions, such as the baseless ideas that protesters at Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings were paid by the liberal philanthropist George Soros and that November’s election was beset by voter fraud.
 
Trump often tweeted well past midnight and before dawn, a cathartic outlet for grievances (Witch hunt! Crooked Hillary, Russia, Russia, Russia, FAKE NEWS, and so on.) For the most part, @realDonaldTrump and its 280-character posts effectively allowed Trump to work around the Washington media establishment and amplify the message of allies.
Sometimes @realDonaldTrump stumbled. Trump deleted 1,166 tweets and, in his final months on the platform, had 471 tweets flagged by Twitter for misinformation, according to Factba.se.
In one of his most memorable Twitter stumbles, Trump in May 2017 sent (and later deleted) a cryptic post-midnight tweet that read “Despite the constant negative press covfefe.”
 
The gibberish set the Twitterverse afire with speculation. Theories included that the tweeter-in-chief had fallen asleep mid-message and that the man who once bragged of having “the best words” was adding a new word to the lexicon to properly describe collusion between Democrats and the press.
The mystery was never solved.
Sam Nunberg, a longtime — and now former — Trump adviser, said that in the summer of 2011, after Trump announced he wasn’t running in 2012 but wanted to remain relevant, his team decided to start using social media to boost his profile.
 
They chose to focus on Twitter, where he already had an account and several hundred thousand followers. Nunberg remembers sending Trump daily reports on his follower growth. Trump would sometimes hand it back with hand-written notes — “Why not more?” “Why so slow?”
They celebrated when they hit the million mark.
“Twitter definitely played a pivotal role in building Donald Trump as a political figure within Republican politics and he also greatly enjoyed it,” said Nunberg. “Remember he used to say: ‘I wanted to own a newspaper. This is great, it’s like a newspaper without the losses.’”
 
Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took to Twitter shortly after the platform banned @realDonaldTrump to note that it continues to allow Iran’s supreme leader “and numerous other dictatorial regimes” to use the platform, but cannot abide his father.
“Mao would be proud,” Trump Jr. scoffed.
In the end, @realDonaldTrump offered an in-the-moment peek into Trump’s state of mind over more than a decade, a period in which the “Apprentice” TV star transformed into the 45th American president.
 
Down the road, when historians look for a glimpse into Trump thoughts on the issues of his time -- anything from actress Kristen Stewart’s treatment of co-star Robert Pattinson to the president’s views on Russian meddling in the 2016 election — the first stop may inevitably be one of the many digital archives that have preserved the tweets of @realDonaldTrump.
With Trump, whatever the topic, there’s always a tweet for that.

"This is a piece about a piece I didn’t want to write. And, subsequently, how I wrote about why I didn’t want to write it. On FB. And how that proved I was right in not writing it in the first place. No, I am not Swami Nithyananda writing pseudonymously from Shrikailasa and teleporting this piece to Asian Age via soooperconshussnessss. (Though I do think there is something to the depth of the physics being equal to the length of the geography.) Hear me out.
Just a while ago, a leading vernacular newspaper asked me if I could write a piece on someone I’m related to. A piece about what it was like growing up under his gaze, that kind of thing.
 
The following day, I apologized to them saying I would have to decline. The editor asked me why. I said it seemed unfair on my part to celebrate this person in this manner at a time like this.
She said she understood. But I don't know if she did. She couldn’t possibly have seen the italics in my response. The reason I declined was not because I thought the person was unworthy of celebration. Or that it was inappropriate on my part to celebrate him now.
It was more to do with how we ought to celebrate anyone or anything at all in these times. And by ‘we’, I mean the privileged.
 
Had I written purely about what he was mainly known for, no one would have faulted me. His work is formidable and relevant.
Not enough people knew that he had another side to him, too: social reformer. And that he had defied convention and community, and fought for the rights of, well, let’s just say, the downtrodden.
The right kind of stuff to recall and celebrate, you’d think, when our country’s rich, selfish and entitled are putting up recipes, work-out videos, and sari challenges as the poorest of the poor are dying in ways we can’t imagine.
 
But I still didn't think it was appropriate to write about him.
By writing in a newspaper, something only the privileged (and by that I mean anyone who has footwear, whose three meals a day are assured, has a roof over his head and won’t die of starvation anytime soon) have access to, or can afford, for that matter, I wondered what I would have achieved.
Would I have disturbed the comfortable, as they drank their second dose of filter coffee, paper in hand, their biggest worry being why their bm wasn’t entirely satisfactory? Would I have comforted the disturbed? Not a chance. Which hungry soul’s calloused feet would my piece have applied balm to?
 
Would the man himself be writing were he around now? I think not. He would be out there doing something.
Within minutes of my posting this, predictably, a cloth-bag-brandishing intellectual, the kind that doesn’t normally grace downmarket dives like my page, swooped in.
“Sorry Krishna,” he expounded. (His ilk never just say, they expound, explicate and expatiate.) “I don't buy this writing vs doing dichotomy. That's lazy theorizing. Sometimes, writing is doing. We certainly need to celebrate writers like this relative of yours. The unslippered anyway take comfort in songs while they trudge along the highways, and who knows one of those songs could be his.”
 
These are the actual words of the gent. And I use that term loosely.
He referred to the guest workers as the unslippered. And he actually believed the guest workers, currently dying on railway tracks and in road accidents if hunger, thirst, heat, exhaustion or plain despair hadn’t got to them already, needed songs, ditties and stand-up comedy, perhaps. And poets, writers, composers, filmmakers should busy themselves making inspirational art to save them, soothe them, as the disaster is still ongoing. Because painting, writing and sculpting were doing, too. Why give them rice, dal and water, was his point, when we could give them life-affirming art and literature.
 
It was as if Nero and Marie Antoinette had had a love child.
It’s not the casual callousness of the ones we dismiss as philistines that we need to worry about. It is the pathological lack of empathy on the part of the so-called intellectual class, the lot that has appointed itself caretaker and curator of art and literature, that frightens me.
The funny thing, by which I mean sad, is despite my FB post being about our appalling lack of empathy, even the ‘positive’ responses, from 95% of the folks, were about this relation of mine.
 
All isn’t lost, though. Saw another post on FB, that of a mother congratulating her daughter on her graduation. ‘Hope the future is full of happy surprises, baby girl,’ she said. ‘Waiting to celebrate once the world heals.’

Within minutes of my posting this, predictably, a cloth-bag-brandishing intellectual, the kind that doesn’t normally grace downmarket dives like my page, swooped in.
“Sorry Krishna,” he expounded. (His ilk never just say, they expound, explicate and expatiate.) “I don't buy this writing vs doing dichotomy. That's lazy theorizing. Sometimes, writing is doing. We certainly need to celebrate writers like this relative of yours. The unslippered anyway take comfort in songs while they trudge along the highways, and who knows one of those songs could be his.”
 
These are the actual words of the gent. And I use that term loosely.
He referred to the guest workers as the unslippered. And he actually believed the guest workers, currently dying on railway tracks and in road accidents if hunger, thirst, heat, exhaustion or plain despair hadn’t got to them already, needed songs, ditties and stand-up comedy, perhaps. And poets, writers, composers, filmmakers should busy themselves making inspirational art to save them, soothe them, as the disaster is still ongoing. Because painting, writing and sculpting were doing, too. Why give them rice, dal and water, was his point, when we could give them life-affirming art and literature.
 
It was as if Nero and Marie Antoinette had had a love child.
It’s not the casual callousness of the ones we dismiss as philistines that we need to worry about. It is the pathological lack of empathy on the part of the so-called intellectual class, the lot that has appointed itself caretaker and curator of art and literature, that frightens me.
The funny thing, by which I mean sad, is despite my FB post being about our appalling lack of empathy, even the ‘positive’ responses, from 95% of the folks, were about this relation of mine.
 
All isn’t lost, though. Saw another post on FB, that of a mother congratulating her daughter on her graduation. ‘Hope the future is full of happy surprises, baby girl,’ she said. ‘Waiting to celebrate once the world heals.’

"Washington: A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a legislation in both the chambers of the US Congress proposing major reforms in skilled non-immigrant visa programmes by giving priority to US-educated foreign technology professionals in issuing H-1B work visas.
The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act, as introduced in House of Representatives and Senate, will require US Citizenship and Immigration Services to prioritise for the first time the annual allocation of H-1B visas.
 
The new system would ensure that the best and brightest students being educated in the United States receive preference for an H-1B visa, including advanced degree holders, those being paid a high wage, and those with valuable skills, proponents of this major legislative reforms said Friday.
In the Senate, it was introduced by Senators Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin. In the House of Representatives, it was introduced by Congressmen Bill Pascrell, Paul Gosar, Ro Khanna, Frank Pallone and Lance Gooden.
The legislation reinstates Congress's original intent in the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes by increasing enforcement, modifying wage requirements and securing protections for both American workers and visa holders, the lawmakers said.
 
The legislation, among other things, explicitly prohibits the replacement of American workers by H-1B or L-1 visa holders, clarifying that working conditions of similarly employed American workers may not be adversely affected by the hiring of an H-1B worker, including H-1B workers who have been placed by another employer at the American worker's worksite.
These provisions address the types of abuses that have been well-documented.
Importantly, the legislation proposes increased crackdown on outsourcing companies that import large numbers of H-1B and L-1 workers for temporary training purposes only to send the workers back to their home countries to do the same job.
 
Specifically, the bill would prohibit companies with more than 50 employees, of which at least half are H-1B or L-1 holders, from hiring additional H-1B employees.
The bill gives the US Department of Labor enhanced authority to review, investigate, and audit employer compliance with programme requirements, as well as to penalise fraudulent or abusive conduct. It requires the production of extensive statistical data about the H-1B and L-1 programs, including wage data, worker education levels, place of employment, and gender.
In addition, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act encompasses several reforms of the L-1 visa programme, including establishment of a wage floor for L-1 workers; authority for the US Department of Homeland Security to investigate, audit, and enforce compliance with L-1 program requirements; assurance that intra-company transfers occur between legitimate branches of a company and don't involve  shell  facilities; and a change to the definition of  specialized knowledge  to ensure that L-1 visas are reserved only for truly key personnel.
 
Asserting that Congress created these programmes to complement America's high-skilled workforce, not replace it, Grassley said that unfortunately, some companies are trying to exploit the programmes by cutting American workers for cheaper labour.
“We need programmes dedicated to putting American workers first. When skilled foreign workers are needed to meet the demands of our labour market, we must also ensure that visa applicants who honed their skills at American colleges and universities are a priority over the importation of more foreign workers. Our bill takes steps to ensure that the programs work for Americans and skilled foreign workers alike,” he said.
 
Reforming the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes is a critical component of fixing the broken immigration system. For years, outsourcing companies have used loopholes in the laws to displace qualified American workers and facilitate the outsourcing of American jobs, Durbin said.
This legislation would end these abuses and protect American and foreign workers from exploitation, Durbin said.
Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna said that American immigrants come to this country with some of the most innovative, transformative ideas this world has ever seen.
 
""If we're going to continue to foster a culture of creativity, we must reform the H-1 and L-1 visa programmes to protect all workers from abuses. Immigrants coming here on H-1B visas have made important contributions to Silicon Valley's leadership in the digital revolution. We want to make sure that talent is coming to the US, but we also want to make sure that it's being done with proper compensation, Khanna said.
Congressman Pallone said that the US must ensure that qualified American workers have access to job opportunities in this country.

"Pharma companies are madly competing with each other when it comes to finding the first effective vaccine against COVID-19. Because of its topical importance, this race is not just between corporate companies alone. It has expanded to being a global competition between various countries (at both centre and state levels) invoking geo-politics. This tight race against time for finding a vaccine to inoculate the whole world is unprecedented in human history.
High Stakes Involved
 
The sheer volume of expected sales for such a vaccine at the moment is breathtaking. It’s a big money game running into billions of dollars. Hence it is not a surprise that many companies want to win this jackpot. “COVID vaccine is going to be a life saving drug and its sales plus distribution should be considered from a humanitarian point of view. It should not be used as a tool for making exorbitant profits by companies to exploit the poor and needy,” explains K.K. Shailaja Teacher, Minister of Health and Social Welfare for Kerala.
 
“All nations need to be given licenses and granted equal opportunity in the production of these life saving vaccines. International agencies like the UN and International Court of Justice should consider intervening, if necessary, to give a level playing field for all countries on this global public health matter,” adds Shailaja, who has become a global female icon and role model in the fight against COVID.
Vaccine Stockpiling 
Rich and prosperous countries are giving advance orders to stockpile hundreds of millions of doses in advance. Poorer countries are unable to match on this hoarding race because of the astronomical costs involved.
 
Sudden stockpiling at present market prices by richer countries could ensure prices for vaccines not to drop in near future. This in turn would not make life easier for poorer countries. This pandemic and global vaccination drive is going to bring in a multi-faceted economics problem as well.
Who Pays for Vaccines: Government or People?
In health insurance driven countries, it is still unclear whether insurance companies would take care of the costs or whether their citizens will have to pay an additional premium for getting vaccinated. In European countries, there is no full clarity as to whether the state would bear all the costs for vaccinating the entire population. In African countries, it is not clear whether other richer countries or international organisations would step-in to help them.
 
Due to the severity of the circumstances, companies are requesting the FDA for an early deployment of vaccines even before the clinical trials end. The scientific data provided by these companies thus far show that their respective vaccines are indeed effective. However, the current clinical trials being carried out are not double blind, and therefore there is an ethical responsibility to let the volunteer know whether they are in the placebo group or not, once the study becomes unblind.

While vaccine availability will be one end-point, we should remember that distributing vaccines will take time and that we will need to maintain restrictions around physical distancing and masks for a good while to come
 
 
— Prof Gautam Menon, 
Infectious diseases modelling expert at Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai
India’s High Population and Centre/State Cooperation
In highly populated countries like India, it is going to be a huge budgetary challenge to inoculate more than a billion people. It is still not clear how the centre and state are going to share these huge costs. Generous donations from philanthropists might only cover some tens of millions of doses inside India which is still a small fraction of our population.
 
In limited budgetary constraints, how to pick and choose the subjects for free inoculation is another tricky subject. Besides all this, even political parties are trying to score brownie points as to where and when free vaccines will be given. It is not yet clear whether only the healthcare workers will be vaccinated or whether the whole general population will be included for free inoculation.
Vaccine Administering Challenges
In addition to direct costs of vaccines, there will be added logistical costs regarding its transportation, storage, administering etc. Vaccinating the whole of India uniformly in a short span of time is going to be a logistical nightmare.
 
Some states have higher budgets than others. Some states have more robust health care systems than others. Besides budget, the most crucial point is the cold chain challenge — i.e. retaining the efficacy of vaccines from point of manufacture to point of administering. Feasible cold chain management plays a key role in selecting one vaccine over a list of other available vaccines. Massive transportation and storage at a permissible range of deep freezing temperatures is a massive challenge in countries like India.
“While vaccine availability will be one end-point, we should remember that distributing vaccines will take time and that we will need to maintain restrictions around physical distancing and masks for a good while to come,” advises Prof Gautam Menon, infectious diseases modelling expert at Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.
 
Why Developing Vaccines Take Time?
 
Vaccine candidates are first tested in animal models (pre-clinical validation). Only the most promising will be carried on in a clinical trial. This trial proceeds step by step, involving an increasing number of human subjects.
“It begins with a small group of healthy volunteers (phase I). If the response to the vaccine is good (no severe side effect but a good immune response), the number will scale up involving hundreds (phase II) and later thousands of volunteers (phase III). It is a blind placebo-control trial: part of the volunteers receives the vaccine, the remaining receive a placebo but they don’t know in which group they are. The volunteers for phase III should be chosen in countries in which the virus is actively circulating because, to calculate the efficacy of the vaccine, you need to compare the number of infections in the vaccine group with the one in the placebo group. This is the stage in which the most advanced COVID-19 vaccines are,” explains Dr Giuditta De Lorenzo, a virologist at MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, UK.
 
At the end of the clinical trial, all the collected data are reviewed by the regulatory agency (i.e FDA or EMA). Only when the agency gives the final approval, the vaccine is considered safe enough to be introduced in the population as part of the vaccination programmes.
“Usually, all together, this takes several years but the speed of the COVID-19 vaccines development has been impressive. Never in history a vaccine reached phase III in such a short amount of time. That was possible because of new technologies available but mostly because the urgency of the situation justified a huge investment of money, a simplification of bureaucracy and the redirection of many resources to this project (putting on hiatus many other research projects). But as efficient as the system can be, there is still a physiological time that needs to be respected: to mount an immune response after the vaccine, to spot any possible side effects and, for the volunteers, to encounter the virus and confirm their protection.” adds Dr De Lorenzo, who works on latest viral research.
 
Fast Tracking — Pros and Cons
When this process is being fast tracked in the present circumstance, it will help to instill more confidence and less fear in the minds of the general public and COVID victims. However fast tracking this comes with its fair share of cons too. “Due to the severity of the circumstances, companies are requesting the FDA for an early deployment of vaccines even before the clinical trials end. The scientific data provided by these companies thus far show that their respective vaccines are indeed effective, and an early release absolutely makes sense. However, such an ‘emergency use’ approval will certainly compromise the ongoing clinical trials not only of these vaccines, but also for those which have just started. The current clinical trials being carried out are not double blind, and therefore there is an ethical responsibility to let the volunteer know whether they are in the placebo group or not, once the study becomes unblind.” elaborates Dr Sreejith Rajasekharan, a virologist at Laboratory of Molecular Virology, International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Italy.
 
None can be directly blamed in this context because the demand and pressure are unprecedented from various interest groups. “As soon as the vaccine will be made available, these volunteers have the right to take the vaccine, and therefore can no longer be included in the control group. If too many volunteers cross over, the study might not have sufficiently large control groups to obtain statistically significant results for certain long-term goals,” adds Dr Rajasekharan, virologist who was part of the team that sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome in early March 2020.

"Singapore: Singapore was criticised for being “cruel and inhumane” Wednesday after a death sentence was handed down via video-conferencing platform Zoom.
Malaysian drug trafficker Punithan Genasan was Friday sentenced to hang in a hearing conducted remotely due to restrictions in place to combat the spread of the coronavirus, court officials said.
 
The 37-year-old had been found guilty over the trafficking of at least 28.5 grams (1.0 ounce) of heroin, a crime punishable by death under the city-state’s tough anti-drugs laws.
The Supreme Court said that it was the first criminal case where a death sentence was handed down in a remote hearing.
Zoom has become popular during virus lockdowns worldwide for everything from virtual school classes to business meetings—but Human Rights Watch criticised its use to mete out capital punishment.
“The death penalty is inherently cruel and inhumane, and Singapore’s use of remote technology like Zoom to sentence a man to death makes it even more so,” said the group’s deputy Asia director Phil Robertson.
 
“It’s pretty astounding the prosecutors and the court are so callous that they fail to see that a man facing capital punishment should have the right to be present in court to see his accusers,” he told AFP.
The Supreme Court said that the hearing was conducted remotely “for the safety of all involved in the proceedings”.
Singapore maintains that the death penalty—a legacy of British colonial rule—is necessary as a deterrent against crime although rights groups have long called for it to be abolished.

"As the first Indian female newsreader and radio jockey, Saeeda Bano left behind a pioneering legacy. Shahana Raza, her granddaughter who translated her memoir, Off the Beaten Track, remembers her as an emotionally resilient person in a chat with Sucheta Dasgupta
Aside from being an Indian radio pioneer, who broke bread with India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, your grandmother was one of India’s first independent Muslim women. Not only was she living by herself in the 1940s, in the 1930s, she drove a car unchaperoned. This is a freedom not available to most Indian women, Hindu or Muslim, even today. Did Saeeda Bano consider herself a feminist?
 
Did Saeeda Bano consider herself a feminist? I don’t know that for sure, but she most definitely knew she was ahead of her times, that the life she led was Dagar se Hatt kar, off the beaten track, which is why she used it as the title of her autobiography.
Your grandmother was more sporting than studious. She was not, in that sense, the typical intellectual feminist. Would you consider her a rebel in her household? How well was she loved by her family?
Relatively speaking, compared with her older siblings, Saeeda Bano was definitely the rebel in her family. The fact that she was allowed to be herself, especially by her father, went a long way in filling her with confidence and also proves they loved her for who she was.
 
In the book, she refers to herself as a girl with “a strange blend of complicated traits in her personality'. Yes, she was more sporting than studious, but she also read voraciously. After marriage she receives both love and importance from her husband’s family as well, especially from her father-in-law Justice Mohammed Raza.
What, to your mind, did she have to give up in order to lead the life that she did and accomplish what she did?
In order to achieve what she did, Saeeda Bano had to, first and foremost, give up the emotional comfort and the financial security that comes with being part of a loving joint family. Embracing uncertainties, she forsook the familiarity and convenience of living in an easygoing city like Lucknow and went off to Delhi at the time of Partition in August 1947, tackling courageously the various challenges that came her way during this crucial time in history. To lead her life according to the dictates of her own conscience, she schooled her heart to face social disapproval.
 
One of the most charming episodes in the book is to do with Saeeda’s friendship with the singer and courtesan, Begum Akhtar. This friendship was forged despite the then prevailing custom of women observing purdah from courtesans. Surprisingly, her interactions with Akhtari met with little resistance at her in-laws’ and she managed to create from them a family tie. Was her husband’s family relatively liberal or was it due to her personal charisma that this became possible?
Bit of both, I would say. Initially, there was some feeble, lukewarm  resistance from her family. Ultimately she managed to persuade her husband Abbas Raza to visit Akhtari Bai’s kotha.
 
Was it Saeeda who broke the ice between lawyer Ishtiaq Abbasi’s acquaintances and Akhtari, thus clearing the path for their eventual marriage?
I don’t think Saeeda Bano had much to do with breaking the ice between Ishtiaq Abbasi’s acquaintances and Akhtari Bai. But after Akhtari approached my grandmother at the radio station and said, “Bittan, please get me married to Ishtiaq Abbasi sahab,” she took the bull by the horns. In her inimitably bold style, she called Ishtiaq bhai over for tea and candidly asked him to marry Akhtari! The rest, as they say, is history.
 
There is a documentary on Begum Akhtar called Hai Akhtari, on YouTube for which director Kalidas Swaminathan interviewed my grandmother. In that, you can hear Saeeda Bano narrate this entire incident in the most delightful manner, exactly as it is written up in this book.
While reading the book, I noticed that when Saeeda examines the relationship of her lover, three-time Delhi mayor Nuruddin Ahmed, with his English first wife, Billy, she concludes that it had faced challenges due to Billy’s not belonging to his own culture of compliant, coquettish or circumspect, women. But she herself was neither of those. Why this inconsistency?
 
Since I never had the opportunity to see my grandmother with Nuruddin Ahmed sahab, I can’t say what she was like with him as a woman. Perhaps she was coquettish and felt vulnerable around him. People do have various sides to their personality. How we interact with our children is not what we are like with our spouse or our parents. Even headstrong forthright women can be submissive when they choose to be!
What is your earliest memory of your grandmother?
My earliest memory of my grandmother is when we came from Lucknow to Delhi during our school vacations to visit her. We would meet up with our uncles, aunts and cousins and spend a lot of time eating all sorts of delicious foodstuff at India International Centre and go on these enjoyable family picnics to Lodhi Garden. She loved picnics! I also remember her cook Shakur Baba vividly.
 
What has been your own career trajectory? Why do you think she chose you to translate her book?
Over the years, I’ve had to transform myself professionally into several avatars. After starting out as a VT editor for programmes and documentaries, I moved to news editing, then reporting, before I finally settled down as video producer and freelance writer. 
Around the time she asked me to translate her book we had grown quite close, without really realising it. We had managed, by default, to forge a strong one-on-one bond and learnt to accept the not-so-palatable sides of our personalities as well. If she ticked me off, I couldn’t go running to any parent. I was living alone and working in Delhi. If I triggered her off, there was really no one she could complain to about my behaviour. With no other adult to help us navigate our relationship with one another, we grew closer.
 
What, according to you, is the strength of this book?
The appeal of the book, in my opinion lies in the brutal honesty with which she visits the past, confronts her own experiences and decides, even when she comes face to face with a painful raw emotion, that yes, I want to speak about this. She could have chosen to leave some hurtful incidents out of the book. But she doesn’t. As I mentioned in the translator’s note, Simone de Beauvoir said in Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter, “The writer is a traitor to his despair as soon as he writes a book.”

"On April 1, a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emailed Nevada public health counterparts for lab reports on two travelers who had tested positive for the coronavirus. She asked Nevada to send those records via a secure network or a “password protected encrypted file” to protect the travelers’ privacy.
The Nevada response: Can we just fax them over?
 
You’d hardly know the U.S. invented the internet by the way its public health workers are collecting vital pandemic data. While health-care industry record-keeping is now mostly electronic, cash-strapped state and local health departments still rely heavily on faxes, email and spreadsheets to gather infectious disease data and share it with federal authorities.
This data dysfunction is hamstringing the nation’s coronavirus response by, among other things, slowing the tracing of people potentially exposed to the virus. In response, the Trump administration set up a parallel reporting system run by the Silicon Valley data-wrangling firm Palantir. Duplicating many data requests, it has placed new burdens on front-line workers at hospitals, labs and other health care centers who already report case and testing data to public health agencies.
 
There’s little evidence so far that the Palantir system has measurably improved federal or state response to COVID-19.
Emails exchanged between the CDC and Nevada officials in March and early April, obtained by The Associated Press in a public records request, illustrate the scope of the problem. It sometimes takes multiple days to track down such basic information as patient addresses and phone numbers. One disease detective consults Google to fill a gap. Data vital to case investigations such as patient travel and medical histories is missing.
 
None of this is news to the CDC or other health experts. “We are woefully behind,” the CDC’s No. 2 official, Anne Schuchat, wrote in a September report on public health data technology. She likened the state of U.S. public health technology to “puttering along the data superhighway in our Model T Ford.”
Holes in the data
This information technology gap might seem puzzling given that most hospitals and other health care providers have long since ditched paper files for electronic health records. Inside the industry, they’re easily shared, often automatically.
 
But data collection for infectious-disease reports is another story, particularly in comparison to other industrialized nations. Countries like Germany, Britain and South Korea _ and U.S. states such as New York and Colorado _ are able to populate online dashboards far richer in real-time data and analysis. In Germany, a map populated with public data gathered by an emergency-care doctors’ association even shows hospital bed availability.
In the U.S., many hospitals and doctors are often failing to report detailed clinical data on coronavirus cases, largely because it would have to be manually extracted from electronic records, then sent by fax or email, said Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo.
 
It’s not unusual for public health workers to have to track patients down on social media, use the phone book or scavenge through other public-health databases that may have that information, said Rachelle Boulton, the Utah health department official responsible for epidemiological reporting. Even when hospitals and labs report that information electronically, it’s often incomplete.
Deficiencies in CDC collection have been especially glaring.
In 75% of COVID-19 cases compiled in April, data on the race and ethnicity of victims was missing. A report on children affected by the virus only had symptom data for 9%of laboratory-confirmed cases for which age was known. A study on virus-stricken U.S. health care workers could not tally the number affected because the applicable boxes were only checked on 16% of received case forms. In another study, the CDC only had data on preexisting conditions _ risk factors such as diabetes, heart and respiratory disease _ for 6% of reported cases.
 
Missing from daily indicators that CDC makes public is data such as nationwide hospitalizations over the previous 24 hours and numbers of tests ordered and completed _ information vital to guiding the federal response, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.
“The CDC during this entire pandemic has been two steps behind the disease,” Jha said.
Reinventing the wheel
Instead of accelerating existing efforts to modernize U.S. disease reporting, the White House asked Palantir, whose founder Peter Thiel is a major backer of President Donald Trump, to hastily build out a data collection platform called HHS Protect. It has not gone well.
 
On March 29, Vice President Mike Pence, who chairs the task force, sent a letter asking 4,700 hospitals to collect daily numbers on virus test results, patient loads and hospital bed and intensive care-unit capacity. That information, the letter said, should be compiled into spreadsheets and emailed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would feed it into the $25 million Palantir system.
On April 10, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar added more reporting requirements for hospitals.
Those mandates sparked a backlash among stressed hospitals already reporting data to state and local health departments. Producing additional cumbersome spreadsheets for the federal government “is just not sustainable,” said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.
 
HHS Protect now comprises more than 200 datasets, including reporting from nearly three-quarters of the roughly 8,000 U.S. hospitals, according to Katie McKeogh, an HHS press officer. It includes supply-chain data from industry, test results from labs and state policy actions.
But due to limited government transparency, it’s not clear how accurate or helpful HHS Protect has been. Asked for examples of its usefulness, McKeogh mentioned only one: White House task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx receives a nightly report based on what the system gathers that provides “a common (nationwide) operating picture of cases at a county level.”
 
“We will continue to work to improve upon the common operating picture,” McKeogh said when asked about holes in HHS data collection. Neither HHS nor the CDC would provide officials to answer questions about HHS Protect; Palantir declined to discuss it on the record.
Fixing the problem
Farzad Mostashari, who a decade ago oversaw the federal effort to modernize paper-based medical records, said it would be far more efficient to fix existing public-health data systems than to create a parallel system like HHS Protect.
“We have a lot of the pieces in place,” Mostashari said. A public-private partnership called digitalbridge.us is central to that effort. Pilot projects that automate infectious disease case reporting were expanded in late January. Overall, 252,000 COVID case reports have been generated so far, said CDC spokesman Benjamin N. Haynes. In December, Congress appropriated $50 million for grants to expand the effort, which is already active in Utah, New York, California, Texas and Michigan.
 
Going forward, the CDC is evaluating how to spend $500 million from March’s huge pandemic relief package to upgrade health care information technology.
In the meantime, public-health officers are still doing things the hard way. Up to half the lab reports submitted for public health case investigations lack patient addresses or ZIP codes, according to a May 1 Duke University white paper co-authored by Mostashari.
“We’re losing days trying to go back and collect that information,” said Hamilton of the epidemiologists’ council. “And then we’re reaching out to hospitals or physicians’ offices that, quite frankly, are saying ‘I’m too busy to tell you that.””

"Love him or hate him, no one can ignore President Donald Trump or his efforts to stay in the limelight. Weeks after the US election results announced 290 Electoral College votes for former Vice-President Joe Biden, Trump still refuses to concede defeat.
Even as Michelle Obama, wife of former US President Barack Obama, took to her Instagram to slam President Trump for impeding the democratic process, while stating that the presidency doesn’t belong to any one individual or party, President Trump has been behaving like a child unwilling to give up his toy despite the end of recess. ‘Hidden’ away in the White House, Trump continues to sulk, inaccurately claiming on Twitter voter fraud and faulty vote counting, falsely proclaiming victory in a race he lost.
 
The ludicrous conduct so unbecoming of a leader of the oldest democracy. But the indignity he presently showcases is merely one of the many etiquette gaffs Trump has displayed on the world stage, be it nationally or internationally. While on the national podium he mocks not only his opponents but also the differently abled, internationally, he makes blunders that may even appear intentional. During his 2017 tour to Japan, for instance, Trump criticised Japan’s inaction on not bombing North Korean missiles, stating not too subtly that modern Japan was weak. Then there was a lunch, where unlike his predecessor Obama who when visiting the Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe in 2014 had dined with him over sushi, Trump chose to eat burgers made with American meat… er… in the sushi capital of the world!
 
Few guidelines on etiquette
1 Practise civility, professionalism and decorum in public forums.
A public servant, an elected representative or even a very senior leader in a company should avoid making belligerent, personal, impertinent and slanderous comments. They must never threaten or abuse.
Example: Who better than Trump himself for an example? He constantly mocked Democratic Party’s presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren for claiming Native American ancestry (for which she apologised later), calling her ‘Pocahontas’. Many of his office bearers took it as a green signal to mock others, including Vice-President-Elect Kamala Harris, by calling her Kamalama, Kalamala, Camel Harris, etc.
 
2 Avoid personal comments | Remember that public personalities are always on display, and whether they like it or not, their actions, mannerism and language are constantly watched by people they may or may not know.
Example: In July this year, reporters claimed to have overheard US Congressman and Republican Ted Yoho, who’d accosted NY City Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), the youngest Democrat in the chamber, on the steps of the US Capitol in July this year, calling her ‘disgusting’, saying ‘you’re out of your freaking mind’, and then using an extreme swear word, calling the latter a ‘b**ch’. (Of course, AOC called out the behaviour in the House floor, to let him and others know that such a language was not acceptable.)
 
3 Honour dignity | As per Donna Hicks, PhD, and author of Leading with Dignity, leaders play a crucial role in creating a culture that brings out the best in people and must know how to honour the dignity of their people while creating policies that are sensitive to dignity issues. And to make dignity and dignity awareness a part of the workplace or social culture, the leader needs to model dignified behaviours. So if a president of a nation appears to not accept the verdict of its people nor honour the dignity of his position, the trickle-down effect could be a chaotic society refusing to accept rules and regulations laid down for it.

"On April 1, a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emailed Nevada public health counterparts for lab reports on two travelers who had tested positive for the coronavirus. She asked Nevada to send those records via a secure network or a “password protected encrypted file” to protect the travelers’ privacy.
The Nevada response: Can we just fax them over?
 
You’d hardly know the U.S. invented the internet by the way its public health workers are collecting vital pandemic data. While health-care industry record-keeping is now mostly electronic, cash-strapped state and local health departments still rely heavily on faxes, email and spreadsheets to gather infectious disease data and share it with federal authorities.
This data dysfunction is hamstringing the nation’s coronavirus response by, among other things, slowing the tracing of people potentially exposed to the virus. In response, the Trump administration set up a parallel reporting system run by the Silicon Valley data-wrangling firm Palantir. Duplicating many data requests, it has placed new burdens on front-line workers at hospitals, labs and other health care centers who already report case and testing data to public health agencies.
 
There’s little evidence so far that the Palantir system has measurably improved federal or state response to COVID-19.
Emails exchanged between the CDC and Nevada officials in March and early April, obtained by The Associated Press in a public records request, illustrate the scope of the problem. It sometimes takes multiple days to track down such basic information as patient addresses and phone numbers. One disease detective consults Google to fill a gap. Data vital to case investigations such as patient travel and medical histories is missing.
 
None of this is news to the CDC or other health experts. “We are woefully behind,” the CDC’s No. 2 official, Anne Schuchat, wrote in a September report on public health data technology. She likened the state of U.S. public health technology to “puttering along the data superhighway in our Model T Ford.”
Holes in the data
This information technology gap might seem puzzling given that most hospitals and other health care providers have long since ditched paper files for electronic health records. Inside the industry, they’re easily shared, often automatically.
 
But data collection for infectious-disease reports is another story, particularly in comparison to other industrialized nations. Countries like Germany, Britain and South Korea _ and U.S. states such as New York and Colorado _ are able to populate online dashboards far richer in real-time data and analysis. In Germany, a map populated with public data gathered by an emergency-care doctors’ association even shows hospital bed availability.
In the U.S., many hospitals and doctors are often failing to report detailed clinical data on coronavirus cases, largely because it would have to be manually extracted from electronic records, then sent by fax or email, said Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo.
 
It’s not unusual for public health workers to have to track patients down on social media, use the phone book or scavenge through other public-health databases that may have that information, said Rachelle Boulton, the Utah health department official responsible for epidemiological reporting. Even when hospitals and labs report that information electronically, it’s often incomplete.
Deficiencies in CDC collection have been especially glaring.
In 75% of COVID-19 cases compiled in April, data on the race and ethnicity of victims was missing. A report on children affected by the virus only had symptom data for 9%of laboratory-confirmed cases for which age was known. A study on virus-stricken U.S. health care workers could not tally the number affected because the applicable boxes were only checked on 16% of received case forms. In another study, the CDC only had data on preexisting conditions _ risk factors such as diabetes, heart and respiratory disease _ for 6% of reported cases.
 
Missing from daily indicators that CDC makes public is data such as nationwide hospitalizations over the previous 24 hours and numbers of tests ordered and completed _ information vital to guiding the federal response, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.
“The CDC during this entire pandemic has been two steps behind the disease,” Jha said.
Reinventing the wheel
Instead of accelerating existing efforts to modernize U.S. disease reporting, the White House asked Palantir, whose founder Peter Thiel is a major backer of President Donald Trump, to hastily build out a data collection platform called HHS Protect. It has not gone well.
 
On March 29, Vice President Mike Pence, who chairs the task force, sent a letter asking 4,700 hospitals to collect daily numbers on virus test results, patient loads and hospital bed and intensive care-unit capacity. That information, the letter said, should be compiled into spreadsheets and emailed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would feed it into the $25 million Palantir system.
On April 10, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar added more reporting requirements for hospitals.
Those mandates sparked a backlash among stressed hospitals already reporting data to state and local health departments. Producing additional cumbersome spreadsheets for the federal government “is just not sustainable,” said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.
 
HHS Protect now comprises more than 200 datasets, including reporting from nearly three-quarters of the roughly 8,000 U.S. hospitals, according to Katie McKeogh, an HHS press officer. It includes supply-chain data from industry, test results from labs and state policy actions.
But due to limited government transparency, it’s not clear how accurate or helpful HHS Protect has been. Asked for examples of its usefulness, McKeogh mentioned only one: White House task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx receives a nightly report based on what the system gathers that provides “a common (nationwide) operating picture of cases at a county level.”
 
“We will continue to work to improve upon the common operating picture,” McKeogh said when asked about holes in HHS data collection. Neither HHS nor the CDC would provide officials to answer questions about HHS Protect; Palantir declined to discuss it on the record.

"New York: With concerts on hold to halt coronavirus spread, the gaming world is increasingly catering to music lovers, with artists becoming animated performers in virtual realms to the trippy delight of millions.
The trend has gained momentum in recent weeks after the ultra-popular Fortnite morphed rapper Travis Scott into a massive psychedelic spaceman performing in a celestial dreamscape, as a record-setting 12.3 million concurrent players entered his 10-minute set inside the game.
 
According to the platform that’s spurred an international gaming craze since launching in 2017, over 27.7 million unique players participated in the Scott show across its premiere and four encore presentations.
And in early May Fortnite launched an enormous virtual party featuring DJs including deadmau5 and Steve Aoki, celebrating its milestone of 350 million registered players.
The pandemic didn’t prompt transforming artists into avatars—DJ Marshmello had a massive Fortnite concert in 2019 -- but that much of the globe’s population has been urged or forced to stay home over COVID-19 has certainly spotlighted it.
 
Acknowledging the unfortunate circumstances coronavirus has wrought more broadly, Adam Arrigo—the CEO of Wave, an entertainment technology company that has put on concerts from DJ Jean-Michel Jarre and now is teaming with artists including R&B singer John Legend—said virtual show business “has exploded” due to quarantine measures.
“It’s kind of given us a chance to show people really what the value, both creatively and economically, of virtual concerts is,” said Arrigo, who co-founded Wave in 2016.
 
‘Visual spectacle’
Virtual concerts in Fortnite or on other gaming platforms, as well as streaming outlets like YouTube live or Twitch, are a different, much more elaborate animal than the concerts many stars have launched recently on Instagram or Facebook live apps.
A musician himself, Arrigo told AFP the virtual experience intends to take viewers “where I can be any avatar I want, or the performer can take me on a journey—just like I feel when I go to a physical show.”
 “You’re not beholden to the laws of physics or gravity, so you can just do anything,” the 36-year-old said.
 
These types of shows see performers transformed into an avatar that uses computer vision and motion capture technology to mimic the artist’s live movements in real-time—“when they smile, their avatar smiles,” explained Arrigo.
Pandemic rush              
The pandemic is an ideal moment to market: Most game developers “are treating this period the way that they would look at traditionally fruitful market periods,” said Dmitri Williams, a communications and technology scholar at the University of Southern California.
 
Arrigo holds that virtual concerts can offer a way forward to bolster the industry, a “complement” to live performances, once they return, for fans to enjoy and artists to earn income from.
For now, income streams include ways to make the virtual concert experience “VIP”—buying virtual goods for your avatar, or sending a performer onstage flowers in the hopes they’ll interact with you.
Ticketed streams at different price points are also an option to up revenue, said Arrigo.

"It’s quite the no-brainer. The lexicographer’s choice of the year at first appearance was gratuitous, but on closer examination drove home the understanding that plague and Spanish flu notwithstanding, in terms of scope and impact, Covid-19 was the world’s first real “pandemic” which simultaneously gave us a taste of the awful homogeneity technology and globalisation has reduced us to, in a reckoning of sorts.
But that is what the word of the year, or woty, as it is acronymed, and pronounceably so, does; be it lived reality or a culture war, it captures the spirit of the times. For instance, last year’s winner was “they”, as used to describe a transgender person, someone who does not identify as male nor female, as compared with or, if you like, opposed to the (cis)gender-neutral pronoun in the singular number, itself interred in 2017 in the Chicago Manual of Style.
 
No doubt, though, “pandemic”, voted in by Merriem-Webster and Dictionary.com as Oxford indulged in some good old fence-sitting by picking not one or two but 16 appellations, had good competition. It mainly came from medical lingo like “asymptomatic”, “contact tracing”, “lockdown” and, of course, “quarantine”, as well as neologisms, often at once political and “viral”, such as “anti-masker”, “the Before Times”, “BLM”, “Antifa” and “Zoom fatigue”, also “Karen” denoting a middle-class white American woman prone to bullying black men in a convenient and self-serving interpretation of women’s rights. But good old “pandemic” — the word first was used in the mid-1600s in the sense of “universal” or “affecting everyone” and began appearing in medical texts concerning the plague soon after — won the vocabulary sweepstakes, “cancelling” them all.
 
Now all this hooha over una palabra might infuriate some of us who like to look down on intellectual gifts and make a song and dance about “deed over word”. We know who they are but we choose here not to name them. Except that the function of the word, of naming, is critical to our understanding of this difficult, maddening, yet endlessly beautiful, world.

"In the fight to halt the coronavirus, several countries have been touted as models to be emulated. Chiefly, South Korea is oft cited, justifiably so. However, no country has met with as much success in holding off and beating back the virus as Taiwan, whose geographical and cultural proximity, literally next door, to China makes the feat all the more remarkable. Contained in this narrative are valuable insights for other countries such as India that are still in the throes of this pandemic.
Situated a mere 130 km off the coast of mainland China, Taiwan has 850,000 to 1 million citizens who live or work in China. Although Beijing and Taipei are adversarial regimes, numerous daily flights link the island to multiple major cities in China. Given such proximity, Taiwan would likely be the most affected by any epidemic with origins in China. In fact, it was the hardest hit when SARS broke out in China in 2003. Taiwan then had the highest mortality rate in the world.
 
That did not happen this time.
Taiwan's Covid-19 numbers have been surprisingly low, for a country that has 2.7 million visitors from the mainland annually and almost 12,000 daily just before the Lunar New Year. As of May 12, Taiwan has 440 total coronavirus cases, of which 372 have already been cured. There have been only 7 deaths. With less than 100 active cases, Taiwan has halted the virus at its doorstep. It managed all this in spite of not being a member of the WHO and while organising a national election on January 11.
How was this possible?
 
Led by Experts
Remarkably, Taiwan’s strategy to combat the novel coronavirus nCoV19 was led by experts and scientists who responded with urgency to the initial outbreak in China. Taiwan’s vice-president, Chen Chien-jen is a Johns Hopkins University trained epidemiologist, public health expert and national hero for his role as health minister during the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Similarly, vice-premier Chen Chi-mai is a physician by training and former lecturer who collaborated with Minister for health and welfare Chen Shih-chung, a doctor and former director of Taipei Medical University. According to Channel News Asia (CNA), at 8 A.M on December 31, the latter was informed of at least seven atypical cases of pneumonia in Wuhan. Within an hour an inter-ministerial meeting was held to determine the measures to be taken to tackle the virus. 
 
This response was as agile as the response in Wuhan itself. Over the next few days, suspected-case reporting and hospital infection control measures were strengthened, a level-1 travel notice to Wuhan was announced, and by January 15 all hospitals and the public were notified about the emerging infectious disease. By January 20, Taiwan activated the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) to coordinate and lead the response to the virus. Daily briefings to the public conducted by health minister Chen Shih-chung, attended by nearly 100,000 people, were also important in keeping the public informed and aware. The health minister currently enjoys an approval rating of 91% in Taiwan and has become the country’s most popular politician, even more than President Tsai ing-wen.
 
Flight Screening and Border Controls
Allowing public health experts to direct the response to Covid-19 meant that Taiwan could make a crucial connection very very early: that air travel was the main pathway of virus transmission. So, Taipei acted quickly to restrict and monitor air travel.
On December 31, the very day China reported the outbreak to the WHO, Taiwan began sending healthcare officials into airplanes to check passengers arriving from Wuhan before they disembarked. Within a couple of days, these measures were expanded to include fever screening and full-scale medical examination of suspected cases. Within 10 days after the flareup of the mysterious new virus in Wuhan on January 21, Taiwan closed its borders to all Wuhan residents, and by 6 Feb extended the restrictions to all arrivals from China, six days before any other country did so. Taiwan also issued a ban on all port calls by international cruise ships on Feb 6, to prevent more cases like the Diamond Princess. To monitor all foreign arrivals into the country, passengers were required to sign and complete a health declaration form. As the virus began to spread outside China to places like Thailand and Singapore, travel advisories were issued to these places by February 11. By early March, all foreign arrivals without a residence permit were banned from entering the country.
 
By strange coincidence or premonition, nearly a fortnight before December 31,
on December 18, 2019, in fact, an awards ceremony was held in Taiwan for airlines with outstanding performance in disease surveillance and aviation safety. At the same event, Taiwan CDC, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced their joint collaboration in implementing the Program for Airlines on Disease Prevention, Preparedness and Response, and Emergency Management, the first of its kind in the world. 
 
Central Command Coordinated Measures
Activated on January 20, the Central Epidemic Command Centre proceeded to implement a total of 124 measures so far, including but not limited to border controls and fever screenings. One of the most significant of these was, contrary to WHO advice, a ban on the export of face masks and a decision to increase the production of protective equipment. The ban came into effect on Jan 24, one month before any other country adopted the same measure. According to the Vice-President, by the end of January, Taiwan stockpiled 44 million surgical masks, 1.95 million N-95 masks and 1,100 negative pressure isolation rooms. A national mask team was set up and 92 additional production lines were installed and the government requisitioned a total of 73 manufacturing companies. The policy increased the average daily production of masks from 1.9 million in January to 16 million masks daily in April. The CECC also instituted a rationing system for masks, according to which every citizen could buy 3 masks per week, then raised to 9 every fortnight, and finally an online ordering system was instituted.
 
Taiwan’s lightning-quick reaction has undoubtedly saved hundreds of lives and prevented thousands more from becoming infected. The island managed this without ever announcing a lockdown and significantly disrupting domestic economic and social life. Taiwan is also able to avoid, to a certain extent, the economic slump that follows a lockdown. Agencies like S&P and other economists have revised Taiwan’s GDP for 2020, but by a smaller margin than any other industrialised country. Schools, offices, restaurants and malls have remained open through the outbreak, limiting the disruption to the economy. Additionally, the island’s approach of involving the public in the fight against Covid-19 has the additional benefit of inculcating awareness in its public, making a transition to the new normal much smoother. With just 65 active cases left, Taiwan has turned its attention to other countries struggling to contain the virus, with the campaign TaiwanCanHelp, which donates masks and other resources.
 
Most of Taiwan’s measures to combat Covid-19 were announced in late January and early February, taking effect almost immediately. The credit for this accrues to experts and scientists holding political office, who lead the fight against Covid-19, calling the shots and responding to developments in China almost instantaneously. The promptness in enacting these measures has been shown by no other country. While some countries like India were busy hosting grand bilateral summits for foreign leaders and others like USA were turning the virus into a political weapon, Taiwan was preparing for the Covid-19 outbreak, which has held the country in good stead in the months following the initial stages of the outbreak.

"A future world war might as well be started with a seed capital of $100,000 or less. That is the sobering reality of the Twitter security breach incident compromising a swathe of prominent people, from former US President Barack Obama to Elon Musk.
In a matter of hours, Twitter had shut down most of its verified Twitter handles and launched an active investigation into the breach.
 
A seed capital of $100,000 or less can be used to do widespread harm by hacking into social media sites that seem innocuous but are now vehicles of a new kind of warfare.
On April 23, 2013, the world saw what a Twitter hacking can do. The official Twitter handle of Associated Press tweeted a breaking story -- “Two explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured”. The tweet came at 1.07 pm and AP’s two million followers on Twitter started retweeting the issue in a matter of seconds.
In his book Future Crimes, author and former policeman Marc Goodman estimated that in just three minutes, that tweet had wiped out $136 billion from the stock markets.
 
A little-known hacking group, Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), admitted it had hacked into AP’s official Twitter handle. The SEA caused massive economic damage without even spending any major resources, and it did not even target a US official website or system.
Just the hack into the Twitter handle of a major private news organisation was enough to cause significant damage.
This is how social media has emerged as a tool of modern warfare, It is free to access, has vast reach, consumes very little resources, and makes the world a target. The current Twitter hacking raises two major obvious issues.
 
One, the social media has to be seen from the lens of national security and the threats they pose. Second, India needs to revisit some of its regulations around the social media and bring them up to date with current realities.
While it is not clear whether the current hack into Twitter was done through social engineering or by paying off Twitter employees, it brings forth another question: how did the hackers know who in the social media corporation had access to these internal tools?
It even managed to reset emails as well as bypass two-factor authentication, even for high-profile accounts including a US presidential candidate and targeted them precisely to achieve their goals.
 
The compromised insider is not a first for the social media. In 2017 a Twitter employee temporarily deactivated the US President’s Twitter account and two Twitter employees spied on activists for the Saudi government.
Both these incidents show the power that site reliability engineers (SREs) hold inside the tech company, and how they can be targeted by simply looking at SRE Meetups held in Meetup.com, an online service that hosts regular meetups.
It is then a matter of time to recruit one of them to spy on a critic that a nation state dislikes, or to convince them to give access to internal tools to post a message declaring war on another state, using the head of state’s Twitter account.
 
As the US Navy Chief of Naval Operations put it so eloquently, “social media literacy is national security too”. It is possible that after this incident, this statement has to be retold as “social media SRE is national security too”.
Closer home, in December 2016 Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and many colleagues found their Twitter handles compromised.
According to Indian government sources, this was done by hackers who managed to get domain-level access to the Indian National Congress’ emails, leading to a cascade of hacks including their Twitter handles.
 
No FIRs were filed, and few paid attention to the national security threat such a hack poses.
What if the hack was done by an inimical power to create political chaos in India?
In the polarised political climate that engulfs India, such a creative use of a Twitter hack is very much within the realm of possibility.
Indians still don’t know what happened to Facebook when their data was found to be compromised by Cambridge Analytica.
And the US intelligence community is convinced the Russians successfully used Facebook to influence the 2016 US elections, propelling Donald Trump to an unexpected victory.
 
An unforeseen side effect of this incident would also be a relook on the safe harbour protections that social media companies enjoy. In India the Supreme Court’s Shreya Singhal ruling allows social media companies to indemnify themselves against any risk posed by content posted by one of their users.
The latest Twitter hack raises difficult questions for India and its safe harbour protections for social media companies.
If a single compromised employee can hijack a former US President or a presidential candidate’s account and post messages on bitcoins, does it not imply that the social media platform is no longer an intermediary and now has the power to create content?
 
Accepting that will be a paradigm shift for India’s regulatory landscape for big tech and especially social media companies.
Would we also eventually end up in a situation where SREs with access to sensitive accounts will need a security clearance from the intelligence arm of nation states to avoid an enemy state hijacking the head of state’s account?
It is quite possible it might, and therein lies the significance of this incident. Social media platforms’ internal processes, systems and their engineers might be subjected to public scrutiny in the same way as that of critical infrastructure systems like nuclear plants, power grids and major transport systems.

As of May 12, Taiwan has 440 total coronavirus cases, of which 372 have already been cured. There have been only 7 deaths. With less than 100 active cases, Taiwan has halted the virus at its doorstep. It managed all this in spite of not being a member of the WHO and while organising a national election on January 11.
How was this possible?
 
Led by Experts
Remarkably, Taiwan’s strategy to combat the novel coronavirus nCoV19 was led by experts and scientists who responded with urgency to the initial outbreak in China. Taiwan’s vice-president, Chen Chien-jen is a Johns Hopkins University trained epidemiologist, public health expert and national hero for his role as health minister during the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Similarly, vice-premier Chen Chi-mai is a physician by training and former lecturer who collaborated with Minister for health and welfare Chen Shih-chung, a doctor and former director of Taipei Medical University. According to Channel News Asia (CNA), at 8 A.M on December 31, the latter was informed of at least seven atypical cases of pneumonia in Wuhan. Within an hour an inter-ministerial meeting was held to determine the measures to be taken to tackle the virus. 
 
This response was as agile as the response in Wuhan itself. Over the next few days, suspected-case reporting and hospital infection control measures were strengthened, a level-1 travel notice to Wuhan was announced, and by January 15 all hospitals and the public were notified about the emerging infectious disease. By January 20, Taiwan activated the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) to coordinate and lead the response to the virus. Daily briefings to the public conducted by health minister Chen Shih-chung, attended by nearly 100,000 people, were also important in keeping the public informed and aware. The health minister currently enjoys an approval rating of 91% in Taiwan and has become the country’s most popular politician, even more than President Tsai ing-wen.
 
Flight Screening and Border Controls
Allowing public health experts to direct the response to Covid-19 meant that Taiwan could make a crucial connection very very early: that air travel was the main pathway of virus transmission. So, Taipei acted quickly to restrict and monitor air travel.
On December 31, the very day China reported the outbreak to the WHO, Taiwan began sending healthcare officials into airplanes to check passengers arriving from Wuhan before they disembarked. Within a couple of days, these measures were expanded to include fever screening and full-scale medical examination of suspected cases. Within 10 days after the flareup of the mysterious new virus in Wuhan on January 21, Taiwan closed its borders to all Wuhan residents, and by 6 Feb extended the restrictions to all arrivals from China, six days before any other country did so. Taiwan also issued a ban on all port calls by international cruise ships on Feb 6, to prevent more cases like the Diamond Princess. To monitor all foreign arrivals into the country, passengers were required to sign and complete a health declaration form. As the virus began to spread outside China to places like Thailand and Singapore, travel advisories were issued to these places by February 11. By early March, all foreign arrivals without a residence permit were banned from entering the country.
 
By strange coincidence or premonition, nearly a fortnight before December 31,
on December 18, 2019, in fact, an awards ceremony was held in Taiwan for airlines with outstanding performance in disease surveillance and aviation safety. At the same event, Taiwan CDC, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced their joint collaboration in implementing the Program for Airlines on Disease Prevention, Preparedness and Response, and Emergency Management, the first of its kind in the world. 
 
Central Command Coordinated Measures
Activated on January 20, the Central Epidemic Command Centre proceeded to implement a total of 124 measures so far, including but not limited to border controls and fever screenings. One of the most significant of these was, contrary to WHO advice, a ban on the export of face masks and a decision to increase the production of protective equipment. The ban came into effect on Jan 24, one month before any other country adopted the same measure. According to the Vice-President, by the end of January, Taiwan stockpiled 44 million surgical masks, 1.95 million N-95 masks and 1,100 negative pressure isolation rooms. A national mask team was set up and 92 additional production lines were installed and the government requisitioned a total of 73 manufacturing companies. The policy increased the average daily production of masks from 1.9 million in January to 16 million masks daily in April. The CECC also instituted a rationing system for masks, according to which every citizen could buy 3 masks per week, then raised to 9 every fortnight, and finally an online ordering system was instituted.
 
Taiwan’s lightning-quick reaction has undoubtedly saved hundreds of lives and prevented thousands more from becoming infected. The island managed this without ever announcing a lockdown and significantly disrupting domestic economic and social life. Taiwan is also able to avoid, to a certain extent, the economic slump that follows a lockdown. Agencies like S&P and other economists have revised Taiwan’s GDP for 2020, but by a smaller margin than any other industrialised country. Schools, offices, restaurants and malls have remained open through the outbreak, limiting the disruption to the economy. Additionally, the island’s approach of involving the public in the fight against Covid-19 has the additional benefit of inculcating awareness in its public, making a transition to the new normal much smoother. With just 65 active cases left, Taiwan has turned its attention to other countries struggling to contain the virus, with the campaign TaiwanCanHelp, which donates masks and other resources.
 
Most of Taiwan’s measures to combat Covid-19 were announced in late January and early February, taking effect almost immediately. The credit for this accrues to experts and scientists holding political office, who lead the fight against Covid-19, calling the shots and responding to developments in China almost instantaneously. The promptness in enacting these measures has been shown by no other country. While some countries like India were busy hosting grand bilateral summits for foreign leaders and others like USA were turning the virus into a political weapon, Taiwan was preparing for the Covid-19 outbreak, which has held the country in good stead in the months following the initial stages of the outbreak.

"Khammam: He waited 40 days as the lockdown kept getting extended, and when the special trains were announced it seemed like a ray of hope. But his village was nowhere near the train routes decided by the Centre. So 25-year-old Kasa Madakami and other migrant labourers began a 500-km walk from Hyderabad to Pandripani village in Malkangiri district in Odisha. After four days in the scorching heat, his journey ended abruptly in Bhadrachalam where he collapsed and died.
Madakami had been employed as a construction worker in Hyderabad. For him and his companions there was no hope left in the city after all the construction work had stopped. The only thing left to do was to go home to their families in their native villages, where everybody knew their names, where somebody cared for them.
 
It was just four days ago, after 40 days of being unemployed and stranded that they decided to start walking, with no hope of getting any government arranged means of transport. Left to their own means, they did not carry enough water and food with for the journey, Madakam Naresh, Madakami’s co-traveller, said.
Walking an average of 80 km a day, they had covered a distance of 320 km and reached Bhadrachalam in 40-degree Celsius heat on Tuesday.
All of a sudden, Madakami collapsed.
He was immediately taken to a hospital but doctors declared him dead on arrival. It was sunstroke, they said.
 
The long walk without water and food in the punishing heat had claimed its victim. “It is a very sad incident in our lives,” Naresh said.
Shocked by his death, Madakami’s friends asked the police for help to take his body home. They hired a vehicle and travelled to Pandripani village in Odisha.
Finally it was the youngster’s dead body that reached home.

"Even as more and more tests are done in India, a trend involving the well-educated and elite opened a risky can of worms.
Various news reports talk about a wealthy someone throwing a marriage or birthday party, inviting several people to it while putting them all at risk.
 
By not adhering to safety precautions they are, inadvertently, helping in the community spread of the virus.
In her Medium article, ‘Why India’s “Elite” is the Hidden Threat of COVID-19’, writer Shubbu Amin effectively talks about the callousness of the elite class through multiple examples of how they speak about ‘Life has to go on’, ‘Oh, but we’re all fine; we won’t get it’ and ‘We are bored sitting at home’. She adds that while only a hand few can exercise those ‘privileges’, their ‘complaints’ not only apply to partying and socialising in person but also put everyone around them at risk so.
 
COVID-19, the great leveller
Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, Hon State Secretary, Indian Medical Association, Telangana State, is certain it is not time yet to celebrate. Instead, he sheds light on how some among the elite believe nothing could happen to them. “Everybody is equal in the eyes of coronavirus. It won’t stop from infecting you just because you are wealthy,” says Dr Sanjeev.
“Often, people think that money and power will get them everywhere, but now that’s not the case with coronavirus.” Then talking about the number of people he has witnessed placing emergency services car stickers so that they can move around freely, he adds how many even tend to ‘forget’ that they still need to wear a mask while they are comfortably sitting inside their AC cars. “It is the air from outside that the cooling system is venting out, which may carry the virus,” he adds, warning, “People need to understand that for the poor and the working class venturing out for work is a need, whereas for the elite class, visiting a coffee shop or a restaurant is a choice. The coming one month is a crucial time for all in India.”
 
Social distancing still the best option
Dr Viswesvaran Balasubramanian, Senior Interventional Pulmonologist and Sleep Medicine Specialist, Yashoda Hospitals, agrees to the importance of social distancing and how easy it is for the coronavirus to spread in the community.
“Spreading of coronavirus among people is very easy even if you are very careful,” he cautions. “That one sharing of a smoke or drink is enough. Social distancing is the best option to contain the numbers and to ensure you do not risk your near and dear ones.”
 
Pointing out how in the US, someone had organised a Corona Party recently, just for the sake of it, which ended in a couple of the guests dying too, he warns that homes can be a huge source of infection too. “Interestingly, the highest chance of contracting the virus is when there is a social gathering at home or for businessmen when meeting many people regularly.”
Behave responsibly
Dr Nikhil Mathur, Vice President Medical Services CARE Group of Hospitals, also believes that community spread is inevitable especially if people with higher income don’t behave responsibly.
 
“Till an effective vaccine is found and distributed, the use of mask and sanitisers while maintaining social distance should be enforced,” says Dr NIkhil. “There is no point in unnecessarily increasing one’s risk of contracting the virus by visiting a public place. With news coming in that the virus can be airborne and that people can be asymptomatic, even if you remove the mask for a few seconds to have a sip from your soft drink while enjoying with friends at a mall, you are still at risk.”
Then, the doctor talks about how once a person is infected with the virus, they are at risk of infecting many others, some of whom may even not have the means to get treatment.
 
“Elite or not, people are still fighting against the social stigma of being a coronavirus patient. It is important to encourage people to come out if they are not feeling well and report to their authorities and get proper medical help. Also, employers among the elite class need to stop looking beyond their profits and look after their employees in need and not cut salaries if they are not being able to attend work due to illness,” says Dr Nikhil adding, how it is a collective responsibility of all to safeguard themselves.

"Mumbai: Big ticket releases such as Amitabh Bachchan’s Gulabo Sitabo may bypass theatres and premiere directly on digital platforms, being seen as a potential saviour for the film industry in a year marred by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty over when cinemas will open.
Faced with the question of going ‘direct to digital’ or waiting for theatres to open after the situation improves, many filmmakers and production houses are exploring the option of heading to streaming platforms, industry insiders said.
 
Shoojit Sircar’s Amitabh-Ayushman Khurrana starrer Gulabo Sitabo, Anu Menon’s eponymous biopic on math genius Shakuntala Devi, with Vidya Balan in the title role, as well as Chehre, another Amitabh film, are among the films likely to be released soon on a streaming platform.
“The deal of releasing ‘Gulabo Sitabo’, a quirky comedy set in Lucknow, and ‘Shakuntala Devi’ on Amazon Prime Video has been locked. The official announcement for both the films is most likely to be made this week,” a source close to the streamer told PTI.
 
Ronnie Lahiri, producer on “Gulabo Sitabo”, neither confirmed nor denied reports when PTI reached out to him but asked journalists to wait for an official statement.
An insider on the team of “Shakuntala Devi” also did not comment about the film’s digital release.
“Chehre” producer Anand Pandit said a digital release was under consideration.
“Given how the lockdown is panning out, a digital release for ‘Chehre’ is being mulled,” Pandit said, adding they would wait till the first week of June to take a final call.
 
The one official announcement was the release of Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s film “Ghoomketu”, which streamed on ZEE5 last week.
Most other plans are shrouded in secrecy with officials reluctant to come on record. But the list of 2020 films that will be released on streaming platforms is long, said insiders.
Top on the list is Laxmmi Bomb, featuring Akshay Kumar and backed by Fox Star Studios, which has reportedly been picked up by the recently launched service Disney+ Hotstar. However, Hotstar representatives maintained a “no comment” stance as did producer Tusshar Kapoor.
 
The movie, directed by Raghava Lawrence, was scheduled to be released on May 22 in theatres. That is unlikely to happen with no signs of cinema theatres opening even if the lockdown ends.
The other 2020 releases—Varun Dhawan-starrer Coolie No 1, Bachchan’s Jhund and Jahnvi Kapoor’s ‘Gunjan Saxena’—are also likely to head to different OTT platforms.
Kiara Advani-starrer Indoo Ki Jawani, co-produced by Nikkhil Advani and Bhushan Kumar, is also reportedly looking for a digital release.
However, Advani said the film is currently being edited “despite physical constraints” and the team is optimistic it will be ready “very soon”.
 
“We are exploring all possible avenues. Nothing stands confirmed or committed. As soon as we are clear about the way ahead, we will make a statement,” he said.
Bhushan’s T-Series’ has two other films, Ludo and Jhund.
While questions sent to Bhushan on the slate of his films were unanswered, a source from the production house confirmed that T-Series is planning to release its films digitally and talks are currently on.
There are also some producers who want to wait it out.
Producer Jackky Bhagnani, who was looking forward to the theatrical release of  Coolie No 1 on May 1, said he is not thinking about films right now.
 
“Let us overcome this crisis and we will announce in happier times,” Bhagnani said when asked about whether he was looking at releasing the film digitally.
Reliance Entertainment said it will wait to release two of this year’s most awaited films — Akshay starrer Sooryavanshi, and ‘83’, fronted by Ranveer Singh.
The team will wait for the lockdown to be lifted and release these movies in theatres.
“We will first complete the film then we will wait. If six or nine months down the line the situation becomes much worse we will take a call at that time. There is no hurry. Same is the case with Sooryavanshi and our other films,” Reliance Entertainment Group CEO Shibashish Sarkar told PTI last month.
 
Irrfan Khan’s last film Angrezi Medium headed to OTT platforms soon after its theatrical release as the lockdown led to cinema halls being closed.
“There is a lot of big money involved. Also, if you release on OTT you cannot release it in theatres. If you release a film in theatre it will come on satellite as well as digital later,” said trade analyst Taran Adarsh.
Last week, the Multiplex Association of India (MAI) appealed to studio partners, producers, artistes and content creators to support the cinema exhibition sector by holding their films and releasing them in theatres once they reopen.
 
The statement followed reports that several films were looking at a direct to digital release amid the lockdown.
The combination of “pent-up demand” and the promise of new movies would boost film business and contribute massively in reviving the industry, the association said.
“The collective, social experience of watching films on the big screen needs to be preserved and it can be done so only with the collective support of all stakeholders,” the statement from the body read.
“One can’t say the film will lose or gain from a digital release, because when you release a good film in theatres, the sky is the limit,” Adarsh added.

"How Pilot crashed
The sordid bid to topple the Rajasthan government has exposed the worst in both the Congress party and the BJP.
 
Going by the confessions, the inspired leaks and the whispers, it is clear that chief minister Ashok Gehlot has not been on talking terms with his deputy, Sachin Pilot, since December 2018.
But Gehlot apparently had a line of communication with the former maharani of Dholpur and princess of Gwalior, Vasundhara Raje Scindia.
Sources in both the BJP and the Congress reveal that Gehlot was a step ahead of Pilot simply because someone from Vasundhara Raje's side was tipping him off about Pilot’s moves. Gehlot, a former magician, kept gathering information and piling up a dossier that read like a charge-sheet. The crafty Gehlot did not rush to Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi with this dossier.
 
A chartered plane was reportedly sent to Thiruvananthapuram to fetch AICC general secretary K.C. Venugopal, a favourite of Rahul; he, in turn, handed over the explosive material to the Gandhis.
The Gandhis are now in a dilemma. Their stated position of opposing anyone having truck with the BJP is compromised as both Gehlot and Pilot were reportedly in touch with the enemy.
Corona protocol
Covid-19 has changed a lot in Lutyens’ Delhi. In the Raksha Rajya Mantri’s office for instance, defence ministry personnel are not encouraged to visit unless they are summoned.
 
The informal list of do’s and don’ts at Dr Subhash Bhamre’s office also demands that officers remain seated each time the minister walks in or out.
Baluni fortunate
Union urban development and civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri made a smart move by allocating Priyanka Gandhi’s bungalow — 35, Lodhi Estate, New Delhi — to Amit Shah’s right-hand man Anil Baluni, who also heads the BJP’s media department.
Baluni is recovering from cancer so the sympathy factor also came into play. Puri’s statement that Priyanka tried seeking an extension was quickly denied by the AICC general secretary but it may have a grain of truth.
 
Apparently, without Priyanka’s knowledge or consent, Anand Sharma or K.T.S. Tulsi are suspected to have spoken to Puri even while Priyanka was all set to move out of Lodhi Estate.
Who broke quarantine
Covid-19 continues to bother the political class. At a recently held meeting of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, a senior official sat close to Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, the Congress party leader in the Lok Sabha.
The additional secretary rank babu tested positive for the coronavirus. Everyone, including Chaudhary, had to while away time in home quarantine — other than a BJP notable who is said to have ignored the advice.
 
Sun shines for PR
While the Ashok Gehlot-Sachin Pilot tussle has stressed out a section of the Congress party, some public relations companies are gloating. A prominent Delhi-based PR person, known to have near-perfect relations with many politicians, quickly grabbed Gehlot’s account.
Every morning, scribes and talking heads on TV covering the Rajasthan slugfest have been getting a healthy dose of talking points on WhatsApp. Pilot’s side is not sitting idle. Last heard, Pilot, an accomplished pistol shooter, has engaged some fine PR personalities. They are not missing the target either.

"Hyderabad: The relative of a person who died of Covid-19 on Sunday has refuted the Telangana government’s claim in its official daily Covid-19 media bulletin that there were no Covid-related deaths on Sunday. The death was not reported in the bulletin issued on Monday as well.
Aditya Belde, a resident of Ziaguda, said his 51-year-old paternal uncle died of the disease at Gandhi Hospital at around 10 am Sunday. “I want to know why his death has not been reported in the official bulletin which was released much later in the day. I think the officials had enough time to update the information,” he said.
 
Belde took to Twitter on Monday to report the death and sought an explanation from the government on the omission of his uncle’s demise from the health department’s report on the Covid-19 situation on Sunday.
Belde’s uncle had been suffering from a heart ailment for a few years. On Thursday, May 7, his health deteriorated, so the family took him to a private hospital. There, they were asked to get him tested for Covid-19 at a government hospital.
“My relatives took my uncle to Fever Hospital the same day. He was taken inside for just around 10 minutes, after which they said he didn’t have Covid-19 and could be taken home,” he said.
 
The patient’s health continued to deteriorate, and on Friday evening, the family took him to a corporate hospital in Begumpet, where he was treated previously. The doctors at this hospital informed the family that the patient needed to be on a ventilator and that he should be tested for Covid-19.
Accordingly a sample was collected and sent to Gandhi Hospital. “On Saturday night, the test results came back and we found he was Covid-19 positive,” said Belde.
Almost immediately, his uncle was processed for a transfer to Gandhi Hospital. Belde was told to accompany his uncle to do the formalities there. “We reached Gandhi Hospital at around 4:30 am and it took an hour before he was admitted. I wasn’t allowed to be near him but I could observe from a distance,” he said.
 
He returned home after a couple of hours. At around noon on Sunday, he got a call from a policeman who told him his uncle had passed away at 10 am on Sunday. By evening, the cremation had been arranged at a local crematorium, which no family member was able to attend.
Nine members of the deceased man’s family, including Belde, were transported to an isolation facility at the Government Ayurvedic Hospital at Erragadda as they lived together as a joint family.
Their swabs have since been taken for Covid-19 tests. Belde wonders why the government did not add his uncle’s death to the official bulletin. “It is very confusing. We need some clarity on this matter,” he said.
 
The family is also upset that their sick relative was made to run around various hospitals for three days before he was tested positive for Covid-19.
“At Coranti (Fever Hospital) they examined him for just 10 minutes and sent him home. They didn’t even collect his samples. Had he been tested earlier, he could have been saved,” Belde said.
At the corporate hospital the doctors told them about the test result only after they had made payment for the treatment there. “We paid Rs 1.70 lakh for my uncle’s treatment. Just 15 minutes later, we were told he was Covid-19 positive. We are extremely suspicious about this, to say the least,” he said.
 
Belde said that his uncle had no travel history. “Since the lockdown began in March, he left the house only a few times. He only went out to buy vegetables and groceries. He had no travel history,” he said.

"The net worth of Kiran Mazumdar Shaw in 2020 is $420 crore. But that is not the only reason why the executive chairperson of Biocon evokes admiration amongst her contemporaries.
Kiran has also been conferred with the prestigious IMC Ladies’ Wing —Woman of the Year Award 2019–2020.
 
Vanita Bhandari, the president of the organisation, pays her tribute by saying, “Ms Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw is a shining light who has broken the glass ceiling and paved a successful path in the fields of science and chemistry. Her vision, talent, dedication and philanthropic initiatives motivate us to aspire high.”
Excerpts from the conversation with Ms Shaw:
Now that Biocon’s ‘original’ drug Itolizumab has finally got the much-needed approval, what is your current state of mind?
It is a truly innovative, original drug, which is made in India. We have not copied any other drug. I don’t think anybody has picked this important factor, which is what makes it disappointing.
 
It is life-saving. This is not a small feat. When the disease gets to a serious stage, nothing can help you except drugs like ours. Itolizumab regulates all cytokines in that pathway.
This is a first drug from India that will stand on its own. Why can’t people be proud of a drug made in India? We believed in this drug for the last 20 years. So, it’s a fantastic feeling now.
Many Indian companies are rushing to claim they can make the vaccine available by September/ October, when experts say it’s not possible till next year. Your comments?
 
You can make a vaccine by this period, but the question is if you can deliver a well-validated vaccine. It is like the Russians claiming they have developed the vaccine, which is fine as anyone can make a vaccine.
Today, if Astra Zeneca develops the vaccine, they also have to evaluate it. You have to do this to check whether there is a possibility of being re-infected by the virus.
Secondly, even if you have responded positively to the vaccine, you need to know for how long you are going to be protected. Realistically, you could get a vaccine by the end of this year, but it is vital to check the safety and reliability factor before even I would use it.
 
The ongoing pandemic has changed everyone’s life. What has your learning been from this situation?
It is definitely something to worry about; it is a serious disease and people have still not understood the gravity of the disease.
But it is not necessary that you are going to die. The people who have to worry about COVID-19 are the vulnerable population. I should be worried; I am over 60 but since I don’t have co-morbidities, I am not worried so much about myself, but I have to remain safe as my mom is almost 90 and my husband is 70 and they are both cancer survivors.
 
You are very vocal with your views on social media and otherwise. Are you not worried about anti reactions?
If you are honest and if you have no mal-intent and there is no agenda, nothing will happen. If I have political aspirations, then maybe it will have an impact.
You put a succession plan in place several years back. At a time when the nepotism debate is ongoing, what made you opt for such a radical (at that time) decision?
 I don’t agree with this nepotism debate because if a person is good you must give an opportunity to him/her but you should not give it just because they are your family.
 
For instance, Azim Premji’s son Rishad is a capable youngster who understands the business at Wipro though they have an outside guy at the helm. My niece — a brilliant cancer immunologist, PhD, MBA from Stanford, Masters from MIT — worked at Third Rock Ventures in the US.
I told her to do something for Biocon. I started a small biotech company in Boston and have asked her to run it. But she is the kind of person who has earned it. As far as Biocon biologics is concerned, I don’t think she can run this.
This is a very professional business and so it is helmed by professionals.
You have a strong, admirable relationship with your husband. What is the secret?
 
I just think it is your commitment to anything. First, you have to make a judgement call about the person and then obviously you will have some differences and arguments, all of which happen in a marriage.
But at the same time, it is a commitment you made. For me, my husband has played a very important role in my life. He has really supported me in a fantastic way.
Not many husbands would be happy to support their wives to be at the front. He has always taken the backseat. He always tells me, ‘It is your business... you have to run it and I will support you but you need to lead it.’ That’s a fantastic quality. We have respect for each other.
 
You are a fiercely loyal friend who has stood by Vijay Mallya through all the tough times.
I am just a good, loyal friend, and there are lots of people who are good friends too. In fact, I would often point out to Vijay to see how many of all his fair-weather friends would be with him when the chips are down. I was right. He agrees with me now. I was the only one who would caution him then, but he would never listen to me.

"Hyderabad: The relative of a person who died of Covid-19 on Sunday has refuted the Telangana government’s claim in its official daily Covid-19 media bulletin that there were no Covid-related deaths on Sunday. The death was not reported in the bulletin issued on Monday as well.
Aditya Belde, a resident of Ziaguda, said his 51-year-old paternal uncle died of the disease at Gandhi Hospital at around 10 am Sunday. “I want to know why his death has not been reported in the official bulletin which was released much later in the day. I think the officials had enough time to update the information,” he said.
 
Belde took to Twitter on Monday to report the death and sought an explanation from the government on the omission of his uncle’s demise from the health department’s report on the Covid-19 situation on Sunday.
Belde’s uncle had been suffering from a heart ailment for a few years. On Thursday, May 7, his health deteriorated, so the family took him to a private hospital. There, they were asked to get him tested for Covid-19 at a government hospital.
“My relatives took my uncle to Fever Hospital the same day. He was taken inside for just around 10 minutes, after which they said he didn’t have Covid-19 and could be taken home,” he said.
 
The patient’s health continued to deteriorate, and on Friday evening, the family took him to a corporate hospital in Begumpet, where he was treated previously. The doctors at this hospital informed the family that the patient needed to be on a ventilator and that he should be tested for Covid-19.
Accordingly a sample was collected and sent to Gandhi Hospital. “On Saturday night, the test results came back and we found he was Covid-19 positive,” said Belde.
Almost immediately, his uncle was processed for a transfer to Gandhi Hospital. Belde was told to accompany his uncle to do the formalities there. “We reached Gandhi Hospital at around 4:30 am and it took an hour before he was admitted. I wasn’t allowed to be near him but I could observe from a distance,” he said.
 
He returned home after a couple of hours. At around noon on Sunday, he got a call from a policeman who told him his uncle had passed away at 10 am on Sunday. By evening, the cremation had been arranged at a local crematorium, which no family member was able to attend.
Nine members of the deceased man’s family, including Belde, were transported to an isolation facility at the Government Ayurvedic Hospital at Erragadda as they lived together as a joint family.
Their swabs have since been taken for Covid-19 tests. Belde wonders why the government did not add his uncle’s death to the official bulletin. “It is very confusing. We need some clarity on this matter,” he said.
 
The family is also upset that their sick relative was made to run around various hospitals for three days before he was tested positive for Covid-19.
“At Coranti (Fever Hospital) they examined him for just 10 minutes and sent him home. They didn’t even collect his samples. Had he been tested earlier, he could have been saved,” Belde said.
At the corporate hospital the doctors told them about the test result only after they had made payment for the treatment there. “We paid Rs 1.70 lakh for my uncle’s treatment. Just 15 minutes later, we were told he was Covid-19 positive. We are extremely suspicious about this, to say the least,” he said.
 
Belde said that his uncle had no travel history. “Since the lockdown began in March, he left the house only a few times. He only went out to buy vegetables and groceries. He had no travel history,” he said.

"A recent post on M.S. Dhoni’s daughter Ziva’s account, which is managed by her parents, a video shows India’s most experienced Indian wicketkeeper and batsman enjoying quality father-daughter moments with Ziva.
In the video, the duo seem to be running a friendly race on their large, well-mowed and primly tended-to lawn at his Ranchi home.
 
And then began the relentless posts of the Captain Cool’s ‘latest looks’ of him with a full-grown salt-and-pepper beard, wearing a green T-shirt with the words “SPECIAL FORCES AIRBORNE” on it, standing
However, former Team Blues captain’s latest grey-bearded look seems to have disappointed many of his fans, sending Twitter into a frenzy. Some seem to have simply seen him as an unshaven, old man! “Aww... M. S Dhoni in Salt And Pepper Look... :-)) ?? (sic),” a CSK fan wrote.
In addition to comments highlighting disappointments were memes that showed “before and after” photos of Captain Cool.
 
One fan, for instance, posted two of Dhoni’s pictures. One was of his when he arrived in Chennai for the practice games of the now-called-off IPL matches sometime last month, seen clean-shaven with a close-crop crew-cut haircut. The second picture was a recent one of him in which he is seen.
One such meme had the caption, “Dhoni before lockdown vs after lockdown. March month he arrived Chennai with a fresh look & we would hve seen him in #Yellove now But corona had other idea & Ruined everything ????.”
Another CSK fan posted his recent pic and wrote against it, “How the men looks after carrying the entire burden and blame for past 10 years..!  This pic is very emotional msdians.. (sic).”
 
Another supposedly shaken fan wrote, “Dhoni looks so old.. (sic).”
Mother knows best
Even as people have been sharing sad emojis and wondering about their favourite cricketer’s cricketing plans (and there are indeed speculations about his retirement), his mother, Devaki, seems far from worried.
Speaking exclusively on the telephone from Ranchi, Devaki tells us, “Yes, I have seen his new look, but he’s not that old. No child is ever old for any mother.”
As for our apprehensions about his quitting the game, she adds, “I am not sure about his playing the TT-20 World Cup. He knows best when to take a call. Let the coronavirus outbreak get over first.”
 
Of course, there were compliments pouring in for the look too. “Vintage white beard look,” one fan wrote with the fire emoji next to it.

"It’s amazing how medical technology has advanced. Half a century ago, for instance, cancer meant an almost certain death. Now, about a third of all cancer patients survive. Not all cancers yield readily to treatment, but there are new ways to detect cancer early, and to treat it successfully.
A little further back, in the early 20th century, pernicious anaemia meant almost certain death. Towards the mid-1920s, it became treatable. Its exact cause was discovered in the 1950s: a deficiency of vitamin B12. Treatment was simple, effective, and inexpensive.
 
There’ve been equally amazing advances in the treatment of diseases of the eye, for example. Sixty or seventy years ago, if you had a retinal detachment, the chances were that you’d go blind. Today, methods are so advanced that fixing a detachment is almost a matter of routine.
It’s not just technology: there are outstanding doctors who used some of these inventions to good effect. There’s Christiaan Barnard, for example, who did the first heart transplant back in the 1960s...
Doctors and technology have made huge differences to lives, but sometimes, in individual cases, there’s also the matter of luck, sometimes dumb luck. Let me give you an example.
 
It began in 1976, in Trivandrum, not long before my school exams. My parents were worried about the effect of all that swotting on my weak eyes: I’d used spectacles since I was 10, and the lenses got thicker every year. My parents thought that contact lenses would reduce the eyestrain, and decided that I deserved a pair, which was good news, because it meant a good excuse to bunk school.
The only place where you could check out contact lenses was the Government Ophthalmic  Hospital, which we knew very well, thanks to those weak eyes.
 
Dad and I went there one sunny morning, and bumped into a technician he knew. He told Dad to leave me with him and not to worry, so I found myself alone in the large, crowded waiting hall, with just enough money to get back home.
Soon a lady doctor turned up, led me to a small chamber furnished with benches, put some drops in my eyes. Some 15 minutes, she inserted lenses into my eyes, and told me to wait awhile. With the lenses in place, I could see rather better, and I enjoyed that for a while. But then, I’d been up half the night reading a new Alistair MacLean thriller, and the waiting was making me unbearably sleepy. Some minutes after the doctor left, I lay down on one of the benches and dozed off.
 
When I woke, the world was blurred again. I had no idea what had happened to the contact lenses. I thought they might have fallen off while I slept, so I spent the next few minutes on my hands and knees, feeling the entire dusty concrete floor for those fragile bits of glass, and despaired when I couldn’t find them.
When the doctor returned I told her I’d lost the lenses. Perhaps she was new: she wasn’t quite sure what to do so, she fetched help in the shape of an older lady doctor. This new doctor found the lenses at the sides of my eyes and retrieved them gently, all the while giving me a lecture on my irresponsible behaviour.
 
When the lenses were safely out, she relented, perhaps because of my nerdy looks, and offered me a bit of advice: if I studied regularly, she said, I wouldn’t have to lose sleep over exams. She saw my heavy spectacles, and continued, “Hmmm! Let me have a good look at your eyes.”
She led me to a dark room with instruments with glowing lights and many handles and levers. After a longish inspection, she shut off everything and led me back to the room with the benches. “You need some minor surgery in both eyes,” she said, “but we can’t do it here. You’ll have to go to Madras for it... It’s nothing very serious, but you have to get it done. Come back tomorrow with your father. Ask for me. My name is Mary Kuriakose.”
 
Next day, she spoke almost exclusively to Dad. “Your son’s retina has weak spots,” she said, “but we can strengthen those. One Dr Badrinath in Madras will do it.”
“He’s got his exams coming up,” Dad said. “Can it wait until after that?”
She smiled. “It’ll have to,” she said. “You’ll have to wait at least two months for your appointment.” She handed Dad a letter referring me to Dr Badrinath. “Write to him immediately.”
Dr Badrinath, was a large, reassuring man with an American accent. He took the time to explain the problem to me, and not just to Dad, and the procedure went off smoothly. One round of treatment wasn’t enough, and, over the next few years, it was repeated several times. Meanwhile, technology kept progressing.
By the 1990s, retinal detachments could be treated with a good chance of success, much better than in the late 1980s.
 
And so, when I had a retinal detachment last year, fixing it was a routine operation, something that wouldn’t have been possible a quarter of century ago.
Then, earlier this year, my friend Dr Kamath found that the cataract in the good eye needed to be removed, and did so late in June. As this goes to press, I’m still recovering from this round of surgery, and, with any luck, won’t need any more.
So, I’m grateful to dumb luck. If I hadn’t gone to sleep in that waiting room nearly half a century ago, I wouldn’t have seen Dr Kuriakose, and would probably have had my troubles before they could have been treated so smoothly. I’m grateful to her, for starting this chain of events. So, from the bottom of my heart, here’s to you, Dr Kuriakose.

"Washington: One week after Sally realised she was pregnant, her home state Texas temporarily banned abortions, deeming them unnecessary elective procedures that were suspended because of the coronavirus crisis.
So, the 34-year-old, whose name has been changed for this story to protect her privacy, took matters into her own hands—something she never would have considered in the past.
 
Having split with her boyfriend, she decided to buy pills on the internet, and perform her own abortion at home.
It’s illegal, and certainly stressful, but more and more women—faced with difficult decisions during a time of national crisis—are going that route.
“It came in a little Manila envelope. And it was just a five-pack of pills. No instructions—nothing,” Sally told AFP from her home in Dallas.
Getting the pills was not easy. The first two sites she consulted were out of stock. After sending $250 to a third site and enduring several long days of waiting, the envelope arrived.
 
By then, it had been 10 weeks since her last period—the absolute limit in the United States for a medical abortion.
“I was so terrified,” she said.
She googled online to figure out how to use the pills for what is called a “self-managed” abortion.
She took the first pill—mifepristone, commonly known in the US as RU-486, which is used to stop the development of the pregnancy.
The four other pills were misoprostol, which triggers the actual abortion. And then Sally took painkillers.
After a night of “really bad” cramps, and bleeding that “shocked” her, everything went as expected. Sally went back to work the following day, “relieved” that the pills worked properly.
 
“I would have rather had medical supervision, for sure,” she says without hesitation.
Beyond the legal ramifications, how does one find websites where the pills are sold? How do you make sure you get them quickly?
Dozens of women like Sally are exchanging advice, tips and notes about their experiences in the abortion forum on the popular social network Reddit.
Soaring sales
A woman’s right to have an abortion is protected by the landmark US Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade.
Even in normal times, that right has come under threat in some conservative-leaning US states. But several states sought to capitalize on the virus crisis to advance their campaigns.
 
There are also natural impediments to getting an abortion in a time of national crisis: the fear of getting infected at a clinic, the inability to leave home to get the procedure, or even financial distress due to sudden unemployment.
To help women buy their own pills online, the Plan C site lists eight online vendors, and ranks them in terms of price and speed of shipment.
The pills sold by those vendors have been tested and declared reliable in 2018.
One online retailer who asked not to be identified told AFP that sales in the US “increased by 150 percent in April compared to March.”
 
Visits to the Plan C website had doubled by late April as compared with a month before.
Plan C co-founder Elisa Wells said that while 900,000 abortions are performed each year in the United States, 40 percent of them medically, at least 10,000 are done “outside of the conventional medical establishment”—either via pills bought online or in Mexico.
What are the risks?
Abortions using mifepristone and misoprostol are safe, experts say. Complications that require medical intervention are rare.
“In the year 2020, in the United States, the real concerns about self-managed abortion aren’t physical but legal,” explains Jill Adams, the executive director of If/When/How, which puts women who want to abort on their own in touch with attorneys.
 
From mid-March through the end of that month, the association’s hotline received twice as many calls as usual.
Five US states—Arizona, Delaware, Idaho, Oklahoma and South Carolina—have laws that specifically ban self-managed abortion.
But women in other states are not really better protected: some local prosecutors use other laws to convict them, such as those forbidding the practice of medicine without a licence.
Some even charge women with child abuse, or drug-related offenses.
In late March, 21 states asked for the lifting of federal restrictions on sending mifepristone through the mail, saying it limits a woman’s use of telemedicine and forces women to “travel unnecessarily” despite stay-at-home orders.
 
To get around some of the US red tape, the websites offering abortion pills are operated from abroad.
Aid Access, which offers the least expensive abortion pills at $90 a dose, is the only one that has a medical supervisor, Dutch physician and activist Rebecca Gomperts.
For the past year, Gomperts has been locked in a battle with the US Food and Drug Administration, which demanded that she stop providing abortion services via telemedicine.
The pandemic has defeated her for the moment: she cannot get the pills she needs from India, which closed all of its airports.
 
Another online provider, which gets its supplies from Russia, told AFP that it expects to be out of stock for several weeks.
The only service that is authorized to send the pills—in 13 US states—is TelAbortion, which has been up and running since 2016, working with about 700 women.
In March and April, the number of women contacting TelAbortion doubled, as compared with the two previous months.

"His bio on Instagram catches the eye. Cinematographer and director of photography for a NatGeo film on Black Panthers the first in the world of wildlife. Hailing from Hyderabad’s illustrious Jung family, Shaaz’s wildlife images have earned him a place in BBC news.
 
An accomplishment that his proud aunt, Kareena Kapoor highlighted on her Insta account. We chat with this talented youngster on the jungle life.
Q What has kept you busy right now?
I’ve dedicated the past five years to documenting melanistic leopards in the jungles of South India and helped produce a feature film for National Geographic recently, for which I was the Director of Photography. It took us two and a half years to finish the film. It feels great to make a film, for the first time in the world of wildlife, on a black panther.
 
Q Your involvement with the family owned wildlife resorts in Kabini and South Africa?
My parents (Saad Bin Jung and Sangeeta) are avid wildlifers and were one of the first pioneers for eco-tourism in Karnataka. That passionate outburst happened after I graduated from University in 2010. I moved to Nagarhole National Park and helped establish an eco-friendly wildlife resort on the banks of the Kabini reservoir. This is where I spend most of my time guiding, photographing and making films.
Q How did your interest in wildlife photography evolve?
It happened after I saw my first leopard, which sparked my love affair with the woods. The camera had the ability to immortalise moments, relish life, protect ecosystems, inspire movements and spark change.
 
Q What has been the most thrilling moment while shooting wildlife?
It would be on safari in the Serengeti this year. I was guiding a group of six avid photographers in an open jeep and we were parked in the tall grass with a herd of Water Buffalos, which are considered to be one of the most dangerous animals in Africa. We knew there was a hungry lioness around but we had no idea where she was. After several anxious minutes, one of the buffalos sensed her presence and was now very disturbed. We were surrounded by an angry herd and they had the power to upturn our jeep in seconds. After a few nervous seconds, the lioness broke cover and charged at a buffalo calf. It caused a stampede and one of the bulls, in a raging fit, destroyed the left tyre of our car. It was terrifying!
 
Q What has your time in the jungle taught you? Is your wife as passionate about nature as you are?
The jungle has taught me the art of patience. It’s inhabitants, such as the beautiful leopards, have been my mentors. They’ve taught me to live by the day and how to appreciate the passing of time, and not let it worry us. My wife Nayantara grew up in New York. After we got married, she moved to the jungle and has quickly adapted, almost like a leopard! She enjoys the wilderness and helped produce the National Geographic feature film on the black panther.

"New Delhi: Under lockdown and far apart, Sushen Dang and Keerti Narang went online to say their marriage vows—and pulled off a spectacular Indian wedding complete with thousands of guests and raucous Bollywood dancing.
In a country famous for lavish weddings that last for days, the young couple are among a growing number modifying their marriage ceremonies under a virus lockdown that has limited public gatherings.
 
Eager to go ahead with the arranged marriage on the auspicious date selected for them by a priest, the pair turned to the internet to tie the knot.
“We never imagined that even our online wedding would be so grand,” Dang, a 26-year-old data analyst who is based in Toronto, told AFP of the April 19 event.
“A hundred guests joined in our celebration on the app. We live-streamed the ceremony on Facebook which was watched by another 16,000 people.”
The nuptials spanned the country.
Dang, decked out in a turban and traditional sherwani kurta, logged on from Mumbai on the coast of the Arabian Sea, while Narang—in her red bridal finery—joined from Bareilly in northern Uttar Pradesh state that borders Nepal.
 
The priest overseeing proceedings chanted hymns as he sat before a ritual fire at his home in Raipur in the central state of Chhattisgarh, with guests logging in from Delhi, Gurgaon and the southern tech hub of Bangalore.
There were minor hiccups—some elderly family members were accidentally unmuted and pets photo-bombed screens.
But the energy levels remained high and the occasion was capped off with a fun Bollywood-style dance performance by their cousins.
The wedding video posted on Facebook has so far garnered nearly 260,000 views, making the newly-weds “feel like celebrities”.
 
Wedding blues 
The spread of the coronavirus and the nationwide lockdown took place as India’s wedding season was in full swing.
In western Rajasthan state alone some 23,000 weddings meant to coincide with the Hindu Akshaya Tritiya festival on April 26 were called off due to the pandemic.
More than 10 million weddings are held annually in the nation of 1.3 billion people, with the marriage industry estimated to be worth some $40-$50 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG.
The sector—like the rest of the economy—is reeling from the impact of the virus, with planners, caterers and decorators among those who have incurred huge losses.
 
“We thought, ‘Why don’t we be the flag-bearers and drive weddings online?’,” said Adhish Zaveri, marketing director at matrimonial website Shaadi.com which facilitated Dang and Narang’s wedding.
“A wedding is probably the most important day of somebody’s life ... and we thought we have to make it as special and close to a real wedding as possible,” he told AFP.
Online nuptials are among a string of weddings in India that have gone ahead amid the lockdown—with some unusual variations.
 
One couple in Uttar Pradesh said “I do” inside a police station after more conventional venues like banquet halls, hotels and temples were all ordered closed during the lockdown.
Home nuptials 
Zaveri said the significantly cheaper online ceremonies could become an option for couples amid the uncertainty about how long the pandemic is going to last.
Couples are charged less than 100,000 rupees ($1,300) for the virtual services, Zaveri said, adding 12 more such weddings were in the pipeline.
To give the online ceremonies a professional touch, make-up artists and sari-draping experts are hired to help the bride, while a folk singer is engaged to serenade the guests.
 
All participants are sent logins and passwords so that strangers can’t gatecrash the event.
Kirti Agrawal—who married her beau Avinash Singh Bagri on April 14 on the balcony of their relative’s flat as friends and family watched on a videoconferencing app—said the digital approach appealed to her.
“Their (groom’s) family had planned a guest list of 8,000 to 10,000,” Agrawal told AFP.
“It isn't that I am not a fan of big, fat weddings. But when I heard about the wedding-from-home idea, I was very happy.”

"For some high-fliers the party hasn’t stopped despite the coronavirus pandemic. A Hyderabad jeweller who threw a lavish birthday bash attended by at least 100 people died of COVID-19 on Saturday. This is not the first such event, since India began unlocking.
In Bihar, a wedding ceremony in rural Patna on June 15 set off the biggest coronavirus infection chain so far, and the groom was among those who died while around a 100 were infected.
In May, a Hyderabad shop owner threw a party after which 45 tested positive in May.
 
In Tamil Nadu, a DMK man who organised a bash for his birthday in Thiruvallur district on June 14 has tested positive for Coronavirus along with three guests.
It may be recalled, singer Kanika Kapoor’s Lucknow party in March exposed several to the coronavirus.
Why are people finding it so difficult to act in accordance with containment demands? Don’t they realise how their actions can affect others?
These are classic examples of the misplaced belief that ‘Nothing will happen to me’. Sanjay Gulabani, chairman, P. Mangatram Jewellers, says,
 
“Each one of us needs to act responsibly. For the economy to not get further beaten out of shape, the lockdown was relaxed. The purpose of the lockdown was to create awareness and get people ready to adapt to the new codes. It is up to us to be judicious in protecting our health,” he pointed out.
“There was general carelessness and apathy towards the problem,” feels Uday Pilani, entrepreneur and investor, who owns hotels in the UK, as well as the FinTech and Management Consulting company in India.
“The Agarwal Marwadi Samaj now has over a thousand affected. The thing is that the recovery rate is excellent, so they are losing fear,” he adds.
 
It’s been difficult to curb the jet-setting crowd from organising parties and society events. “Now is not the time to show your status; it’s time to show responsibility. The vast majority of the people who are defying calls for social distancing are not realising that it’s not about just them... it’s about taking a risk with their families and friends as well. It’s time we all get responsible and accept that precaution is better than cure,” says Madhu Jain, an entrepreneur.
While the world’s scientists are working towards finding a cure and vaccines for COVID-19, we need to take all preventive measures, feels Bina Mehta, another entrepreneur.
 
“Social distancing will only ‘flatten the curve’. Let us all understand and respect our own lives and value others’ lives too. It is a sin to invite people to events, and an even bigger sin to be part of any event,” says Bina.
Life doesn’t have to stop because of the Coronavirus, but it’s smart to re-evaluate priorities, feels entrepreneur Vinod Ranka,. “I was invited to few parties and weddings, but I declined the invitations,” he says, giving an example of how priorities should change.

"New Delhi: Under lockdown and far apart, Sushen Dang and Keerti Narang went online to say their marriage vows—and pulled off a spectacular Indian wedding complete with thousands of guests and raucous Bollywood dancing.
In a country famous for lavish weddings that last for days, the young couple are among a growing number modifying their marriage ceremonies under a virus lockdown that has limited public gatherings.
 
Eager to go ahead with the arranged marriage on the auspicious date selected for them by a priest, the pair turned to the internet to tie the knot.
“We never imagined that even our online wedding would be so grand,” Dang, a 26-year-old data analyst who is based in Toronto, told AFP of the April 19 event.
“A hundred guests joined in our celebration on the app. We live-streamed the ceremony on Facebook which was watched by another 16,000 people.”
The nuptials spanned the country.
Dang, decked out in a turban and traditional sherwani kurta, logged on from Mumbai on the coast of the Arabian Sea, while Narang—in her red bridal finery—joined from Bareilly in northern Uttar Pradesh state that borders Nepal.
 
The priest overseeing proceedings chanted hymns as he sat before a ritual fire at his home in Raipur in the central state of Chhattisgarh, with guests logging in from Delhi, Gurgaon and the southern tech hub of Bangalore.
There were minor hiccups—some elderly family members were accidentally unmuted and pets photo-bombed screens.
But the energy levels remained high and the occasion was capped off with a fun Bollywood-style dance performance by their cousins.
The wedding video posted on Facebook has so far garnered nearly 260,000 views, making the newly-weds “feel like celebrities”.
 
Wedding blues 
The spread of the coronavirus and the nationwide lockdown took place as India’s wedding season was in full swing.
In western Rajasthan state alone some 23,000 weddings meant to coincide with the Hindu Akshaya Tritiya festival on April 26 were called off due to the pandemic.
More than 10 million weddings are held annually in the nation of 1.3 billion people, with the marriage industry estimated to be worth some $40-$50 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG.
The sector—like the rest of the economy—is reeling from the impact of the virus, with planners, caterers and decorators among those who have incurred huge losses.
 
“We thought, ‘Why don’t we be the flag-bearers and drive weddings online?’,” said Adhish Zaveri, marketing director at matrimonial website Shaadi.com which facilitated Dang and Narang’s wedding.
“A wedding is probably the most important day of somebody’s life ... and we thought we have to make it as special and close to a real wedding as possible,” he told AFP.
Online nuptials are among a string of weddings in India that have gone ahead amid the lockdown—with some unusual variations.
 
One couple in Uttar Pradesh said “I do” inside a police station after more conventional venues like banquet halls, hotels and temples were all ordered closed during the lockdown.
Home nuptials 
Zaveri said the significantly cheaper online ceremonies could become an option for couples amid the uncertainty about how long the pandemic is going to last.
Couples are charged less than 100,000 rupees ($1,300) for the virtual services, Zaveri said, adding 12 more such weddings were in the pipeline.
To give the online ceremonies a professional touch, make-up artists and sari-draping experts are hired to help the bride, while a folk singer is engaged to serenade the guests.
 
All participants are sent logins and passwords so that strangers can’t gatecrash the event.

"London: Bitcoin miners, whose computer processors enable the running of the world’s most popular virtual currency, will soon face an event that takes place every four years and alters the profitability of the hi-tech industry.
So-called halving is when cryptocurrency-mining companies and individuals find out the reduced payment that they will receive in return for their contribution to the system’s smooth operation.
 
Bitcoin was created in 2008 by a person or group writing under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto as a peer-to-peer decentralised electronic cash system.
The virtual unit was once the preserve of internet geeks and hobbyists but it has since exploded in popularity, with mining performed by huge banks of computers.
How does mining work
Bitcoins are traded via a decentralised registry system known as a blockchain.
The system requires massive computer processing power in order to manage and implement transactions.
That power is provided by miners, who do so in the hope they will receive new bitcoins for validating transaction data.
 
The system poses a complex computer puzzle to decide which miner wins the privilege to validate the block and thus receive the reward.
“To understand halving, it is important to remember the role of miners, who are basically responsible for the bitcoin network security,” ThinkMarkets analyst Fawad Razaqzada told AFP.
“Each time a block of bitcoin transaction takes place, they need to be verified by miners. The miner that verifies each block gets a reward for its work with more, newly created, bitcoins.”
What is halving?
 
This occurs every four years and basically involves the halving of the reward from bitcoin mining.
The cryptocurrency’s first “halving” occurred in November 2012, and the second in July 2016. The third is widely expected to take place around next Tuesday.
“Halving will impact profitability of mining bitcoin because work and resources will need to double in order to achieve the same reward as before,” added Razaqzada.
“However, if the value of bitcoin appreciates significantly then this will offset some of the costs.”
 
Commercial mining operations often occupy huge hangers or warehouses, and consume large amounts of electricity to power and cool the computers, which is a considerable cost in addition to equipment.
Why reduce the reward?
The reward was originally set at 50 bitcoins but it was subsequently reduced to 12.5 and will likely reach just 6.25 next week.
The amount has been trimmed over time in order to implement an overall global limit of 21 million bitcoins.
“With the supply of bitcoins mandated to eventually reach the limit of 21 million, the creator(s) of the digital currency had decided that these rewards must decay exponentially, otherwise supply will not be controlled,” added Razaqzada.
 
“So, the network is programmed to cut the reward every 210,000 blocks, or about every four years,” he said, noting that the halving date depended on mining activity.
What is bitcoin worth?
Bitcoin stood late Tuesday at $9,200 (Rs 7,00,000 approx) after a choppy few months linked to coronavirus markets turmoil.
That compares with $7,100 (Rs 5,40,000 approx) at the start of the year, according to Bloomberg data, but it remains far from the record high $19,511 (Rs 14,80,000) hit in December 2017.
“February and March were rough months for bitcoin like other risk assets, but the digital currency has staged the most impressive recovery,” said Razaqzada.
 
“This is partly due to the fact some investors consider bitcoin to be a safe-haven asset, while some have undoubtedly bought speculatively ahead of the so-called ‘halving’ event in anticipation (that) we may see the value of the cryptocurrency appreciate.”

"Who’s that attorney?
The induction of a law officer from Gujarat as additional solicitor general has suddenly turned up the legal heat on many in the national capital, particularly those belonging to the UPA regime. Senior lawyer S.V. Raju was appointed as ASG and brought from Gujarat.
 
The legal community is abuzz with reports that Mr Raju has a direct line to the “Big Two” and is keeping them informed about pending and fresh legal cases. AICC treasurer Ahmed Patel is already facing the heat from the Enforcement Directorate. More drama and trouble for the Congress is expected in the coming months.
Like father, unlike son
Shourya Doval is a man of many shades. Hailing from the Garhwal region, young Doval seems keen to chalk out his own path distinct from his illustrious father, national security advisor Ajit Doval.
 
During the 2019 parliamentary polls, Uttarakhand was rife with rumour that Shourya would be fielded from the Pauri Garhwal seat but local political dynamics played out differently. Shourya has been taking an active interest in the socio-cultural activities in the hill state. He was recently spotted in an online programme that was organised by Congress leader Harish Rawat.
Nath still in reckoning
Madhya Pradesh is the number one tiger state in the country. But who is tiger number one? A political debate and war of words is raging in the central Indian state with both chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia delivering Salman Khan’s dialogue, “Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai”.
 
On the political barometer, Scindia seems one up on Chouhan having managed to get all his supporters inducted in the Chouhan ministry while the CM cut a sorry figure in having to keep out many of his loyal supporters who were ministerial colleagues in the previous BJP regime.
Crucial Assembly by-polls in 24 seats will be held shortly where all 24 (mostly MLAs who had defected from the Congress to BJP with Scindia) will be in the fray. The Congress is hoping to get at least half of them defeated. If that happens, it will be Kamal Nath’s turn to say, “Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai”.
 
Cricketing ‘estate’
While speculation was rife that the late Arun Jaitley’s daughter Sonali Jaitley Bakshi may join politics, the former minister's son Rohan is said to be keen to pursue his dad’s passion for cricket administration.
The Delhi and District Cricket Association poll is on the cards to fill six vacant posts — president, treasurer and four directors. The two key positions of president and treasurer have been vacant since Rajat Sharma tendered his resignation on November 29, 2019, and O.P. Sharma was disqualified from office as treasurer. Ombudsman Justice (Retd) Deepak Verma ordered Sharma’s disqualification as treasurer as he is an elected member of the Delhi legislative Assembly. If Rohan contests and wins he will be occupying a post that was once held by Arun Jaitley.
 
PM’s subterfuge
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise visit to Leh was well-planned. Informed sources say that as per strategy, defence minister Rajnath Singh’s name was first announced. Hours before Modi’s visit, the defence minister called off his tour to Ladakh where Chinese forces have adopted an aggressive posture. Rajnath was kept in the loop throughout. He was first to go public in lauding the PM’s inspiring speech delivered at Nimu base.

"With retailers and clothing units shutting shop, and millions of workers scrambling to make ends meet, nobody frankly knows the future of fashion. Experts say need-based sustainable fashion will rule.
Neil Pate
 
The coronavirus crisis has crumpled the social fabric of our lives and the fashion industry like. Be it the way we address our financial goals or the way we dress.
Even as fashion titans like Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci and some Indian designers are casting their bread upon the waters to create safe and sustainable clothing (including PPE), the most that we can do is wait. And watch!
Fashion historians point out that people changed their dressing style after the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the Great Depression and World War II. The 2020 Covid-19 pandemic is no exception.
 
With retailers and clothing units shutting shop, and millions of workers scrambling to make ends meet, nobody frankly knows the future of fashion or the new ‘quarantrends’.
A la Mode
Some designers say dressier days are on the horizon as people would want to spread cheer and positive vibes. Some opine dull and somber attire goes with the current mood. Yet, a few others are optimistic of the easy-on-the-eye-and-pocket florals.
The online market of second-hand and recycled clothes, shoes and accessories has already seen a spike. You may nod and naff in equal measure, but it looks like Back to Basics!
 
Ritu Kumar, the doyenne of Indian fashion industry, who began her career in 1969 with just four hand block printers and two tables in a small village near Calcutta (now Kolkata), says that there were recessionary trends in the fashion industry even before the pandemic.
“Business had slowed down after demonetisation. Now, there will be a trend of need-based buying. I won’t be surprised if we are pushed back by another 20 years,” says Kumar, whose understanding of ancient Indian designs, traditional crafts and Indian fashion market is unmatched.
 
She adds that you cannot compare the Indian fashion industry to the international ones. “The fashion industry in the western world has been there for over 100-150 years. The Indian fashion industry has been around for only 30-40 years.”
However, Kumar feels the saree, kurta and kurtis will make a comeback to beat the corona blues. “A saree suits all occasions. It is low on maintenance too. Men usually spend on branded shirts and trousers. But now people will move towards ethnic wear. The kurta will be the much-favoured choice for men and women,” she says.
 
Beleaguered Workforce
India has an estimated 16 million crafts-people working in the textile industry.  A majority of them in rural areas and are involved in the most intricate work like weaving, embroidery and creation of embellishments etc.
These craftsmen have mastered their craft over centuries and passed it on from one generation to the other. The pandemic has brought about an “unprecedented” crisis.
Today, thousands of craftsmen are without work. Customers are still hesitant to enter malls and shops to buy clothes although there has been a spike in online shopping.
 
Jugnu Gosrani, a Mumbai-based designer, who creates free-spirited clothes, says all her sales are online.
“We are all saddled with unsold merchandise. This month, I managed to sell kurtis, dresses and skirts online in my housing society itself. Customers order online. I leave the outfit outside their door in a sealed plastic bag,” explains Jugnu. She is certain that people will stick to affordable and sustainable clothes.
The only ‘In thing’ right now are protective masks. Jeans, joggers and leggings are also in demand. Whether you step out to run errands or go for a jog. The mask is here to stay for a long time. “I’m making kalamkari masks from the leftover fabrics,” Jugnu adds.
 
No Big Spenders  
Designer Rina Dhaka feels it is impossible to quantify the losses since it is interlinked from retail giants to exporters to the migrant workers. “Work is a struggle and one is trying to get up again,” she says.
After the pandemic, Rina plans to move back to crafts, wovens and sustainable models of fashion. “I will also simplify the couture. Maybe more as singles or separates to make the spending easier,” she says.  
Grapevine from the fashion circuit tells us that nearly four designers and their loved ones have had a close brush with the virus. Earlier, designers had to run the gauntlet of TV cameras and fashion photographers.
 
Now, it will take plenty of pluck to re-fashion one’s business model and pull through the mess. The Fashion Design Council of India has already announced a Covid-19 Support Fund for small businesses and young designers in need.
Ritu Kumar is certain that fast fashion will be out. “In India, people purchase clothes for functions and festivals (Diwali, Eid, Christmas, Baisakhi) unlike the west where the fashion ramp is dictated by changing seasons and colours.” Kumar is optimistic that people will bounce back. “We will have to focus on ‘Make in India’ to pull through this crisis,” she says.  
 
Make Every Outfit Count
Today, millions of people are either out of work or have taken pay cuts. The recession has forced people to set their priorities and rethink their spending.  Nishit Gupta, director of KALKI says people are tired of this panic mode.
“Fashion trends will vary as the world slowly emerges from the global quarantine. With weddings now becoming more intimate, smaller in size, the fusion trends will find favour with both brides and bridesmaids. Mirror lehengas, organza skirts, pre-stitched sarees, necklet gowns, dhoti-crop tops in handwoven fabrics and hand-done embroideries with traditional textile techniques will trend. It will also help support the rural artisans and handloom communities,” says Nishit.
 
The pandemic shockwaves have hit every industry. The ‘new normal’ will make us slow down, and reinvent how we view consumption and production.
“If you view forecasts, by next year from a slated -4% drop this year in the GDP, we may be able to achieve a growth of 4% in 2021, provided we take control of the production and job creation by being self sufficient,” says Bahaar Dhawan Rohatgi, a Delhi-based lawyer-cum-visual artist and influencer.
She hopes the fashion sector will become more responsible and sustainable.
 
“I hope aficionados will promote products that employ environmental-friendly, fair practices, minimise waste and boast functionality. We may witness a tipping point where designers will be drawn to celebrate austerity, emphasising a classless society (remember post war ‘Austerity Britain drive’ in the 1940s) signifying affordability, access to leisure, health, value life and maintaining balance,” says Bahaar. Perhaps need-based sustainable dressing is the glamour we’ve been missing!

"As a reprisal to China’s incursions into Indian territory, the Narendra Modi government has banned 59 Chinese apps because they were allegedly ""prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order"". A majority of these apps were popular amongst India’s 500 million internet users.
India is the fastest growing consumer internet market in the world, with 19 billion downloads in 2019. That positions India as the second largest market for app downloads. But does aatmanirbhar India have the alternatives to these apps that can quickly fill the space vacated by the Chinese apps?

"Cast: Sushmita Sen, Chandrachur Singh, Sikandar Kher, Ankur Bhatia, Alexx ONell, Namit Das, Manish Choudhary, Sohaila Kapur, Jayant Kripalani, Vishwajeet Pradhan, Vikas Kumar, Virti Vaghani, Viren Vazirani, Pratyaksh Panwar, Sugandha Garg, Maya Sarao 
Creator & director: Ram Madhvani, Sandeep Modi
 
Rating: ***1/2
Let me just say it straight up — Sushmita Sen is insanely attractive. And Aarya, created and directed by Ram Madhvani and Sandeep Modi, is a riveting watch.
Sushmita is sexy, glamorous, glowing, fit, and she commands and controls the camera’s lens as if it were her drooling fan. Sushmita is also a star and she brings all her star power to ground Aarya. But Sushmita isn’t a great actress. Her acting chops are limited to giving a few “looks”.
That's why the show’s directors have had to conspire with cinematographer Harshvir Oberai and editors (Khushboo Ra, Abhimanyu Chaudhary) to cut, chop, fade, zoom in, go slomo, use every trick available to insinuate that she is acting, moving, while keeping her gorgeous face and its one expression on the screen.
 
But Sushmita Sen’s repertoire is too tiny, too meagre for us to be fooled.
We love her warm charm, but hope that by season two she grows from just giving a “look” and learns to transition from one expression to another without the help of editing.
Aarya is based on the Dutch series Penoza (meaning, the underworld), which began airing in 2010, was a huge hit and went on for five seasons. Penoza told the story of Carmen, an Amsterdam woman — a wife, a mother, and then a widow and a godmother — who is forced to take over her husband’s business to pay off his various debts.
 
It was remade in the US because of the universal appeal of its themes of love, loyalty, betrayal and family ties, but it didn’t fly. Now the series, about a mother protecting her children, has found a happy, natural home in Rajasthan, India.
Set in the desert state's rotting mini-royalty, Aarya’s first season is based on the original almost scene-by-scene, with just a few changes thrown in to fit its milieu.   
The series' first and last episodes open with Aarya (Sushmita Sen) hanging upside down on TRX straps, a familiar sight for those who follow Ms Sen’s Instagram account.
 
In between these two scenes is the story of three business partners, a stolen drug consignment, a murder and a woman torn between her two families -- father, mother, sister and brother on one side, and husband, daughter and two sons on the other.
A cop is after business secrets, the mafia is after the drugs, a business partner has begun to unravel and everyone seems to be hiding something.
As Aarya takes charge, some things go as planned, while others don’t.
Another murder, a kidnapping, deceit. With every threat coiling around her family, tightening its grip, Aarya's moral compass shifts to one that is beyond all moral considerations -- the mother who will protect her brood at all cost.
 
Every time things get too dreary, Aarya distracts itself and us by playing some LP records of Bollywood oldies — to take a deep breath and relive happy memories before the next dark twist.
This is the series' trick that keeps us hooked. Like Aarya, we too yearn for the husband-wife in love, the sunshine days of a happy family…

I have a very simple test of how good a serial is. If I binge watch it in one go while battling sleep and despite a busy early morning looming, then it's very good.
If I can take a break, but must then return to it asap, then it's good. And if I take a break but then browse around for other stuff, it's blah.
 
Aarya is good. Quite good, actually. But I could take a day’s break.
It's not Pataal Lok good, though Aarya more than makes up for the dearth of women in that masculine, macho series.
Half-way through Aarya I could figure who is behind it all, yet I was immersed in the intrigues of this world of Audis and Mercs, mistresses and sex, because of the excellent ensemble of actors and its brilliant screenplay.
Though it’s almost a copy-cut-paste job of the original, Aarya has a high production value, it looks and feels posh and its big scenes are made up of lovely, small details.
 
Aarya has a long list of actors, and each one gets a character that either has layers and complications or grand, powerful scenes. And while everyone is good, some are just stand-out fabulous.  
Chandrachur Singh as Aarya's husband Tej is delightfully normal and adorable. Jayant Kripalani as Aarya's father Zorawar, with Sikandar Kher as his point man Daulat, are deliciously dark and together they create the swag and rot of Rajasthani royalty.
Namit Das as the coke-snorting Jawahar is manic, unpredictable, and Vikas Kumar as the earnest but annoying ACP Khan creates a character that will outlive the series.
 
Manish Choudhary as the Russians’ peddler-distributor Shekhawat, Vishwajeet Pradhan as his man Sampat, Sohaila Kapur as Zorawar's bitter, day-drinking wife Rajeshwari, and Maya Sarao as Maya all have a few big scenes and with each one they add muscle and moxie to the series.
 
Even the three kids — played by Virti Vaghani, Viren Vazirani and Pratyaksh Panwar — are measured, memorable.
Writers Sandeep Srivastav and Anu Singh Choudhary have embellished Sushmita’s character with items from her life, making it, in some ways, an extension of the actor’s own personality.
 
Apart from the hanging routine, there's rousing chanting of stanzas from the Gita, again a regular feature on Sushmita's Instagram.
Sushmita's character, which has been given an Eileen Fisher type of layered, minimalist but chic mommy wardrobe, keeps calling all her children “Bachcha”, instead of by their name.
A trait of a woman who is a natural caregiver, perhaps. But it’s jarring and sticks out as an affectation because of Sushmita's studied attempt at ""acting"",
Sushmita has powerful screen presence, but her dialogue delivery is the sort you hear in acting classes — rehearsed, deliberate, read out.
 
She's got everything going for her. All she needs now is a little fluidity and to shed some of her diva gold dust.

"Paris: Tech giants love to portray themselves as forces for good and as the United States was gripped by anti-racism protests a number of them publicly disavowed selling controversial facial recognition technology to police forces.
Facial recognition has numerous applications that could simplify our lives as we’ve seen with Apple using it to unlock smartphones or in stores to replace cash registers.
 
But the technology has a dark side, with facial recognition integrated into China’s massive public surveillance system and its social credit experiment where even minor infractions of public norms can result in sanctions.
As the protests spread across the United States about police violence and racism, pressure mounted on tech firms about the technology. Microsoft and Amazon announced they would suspend sales of facial recognition software to police forces while IBM said it would exit the business.
Privacy and rights groups worry about the implications of the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement.
 
‘Extremely intrusive’ technology        
“It is an extremely intrusive form of surveillance and can seriously undermine our freedoms and eventually our society as a whole,” says Privacy International.
“The biggest danger is that this technology will be used for general, suspicionless surveillance systems,” says for its part the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
It notes that US state governments hold extensive photo databases as part of their motor vehicle departments, which if combined with public surveillance or other cameras, could result in “a comprehensive system of identification and tracking”.
 
In January 2020, a New York Times investigation pulled back the curtain on the activities of Californian startup Clearview AI, whose facial recognition tool “could end your ability to walk down the street anonymously”.
Social network photos scraped          
That is because Clearview AI doesn’t use photos held by governments, but billions of photos scraped from social media sites.
While social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube (Google) and LinkedIn (Microsoft) protested against the unsanctioned use of their users’ photos, Clearview hasn’t acceded to their demands to delete them.
 
The firm, which received funding from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, says it has already signed up 600 law enforcement agencies worldwide.
According to advocacy group AlgorithmWatch, at least 10 European police forces already use facial recognition technology and haven’t needed to turn to the tech giants.
“I have never seen a contract between Microsoft, Amazon or IBM and a police force in the investigations I have done on the subject,” said journalist Nicolas Kayser-Bril, who did the research behind the AlgorithmWatch report.
 
Technology already widely available              
“Tools for conducting facial recognition are widely available,” he added, noting that BriefCam, a subsidiary of Japanese multinational Canon which specialises in ultra-rapid analysis of images, is one of the leaders in the European market.
China has begun to export its facial recognition technology, particularly via its telecoms equipment giant Huawei.
A company executive told a business forum in Morocco last year that with its technology not only the identity of a person can be identified, but educational and work experience, personal preferences and recent travel.
 
In February, The Intercept cited a report that 10 European police forces are considering a joint network for facial recognition searches by extending agreements in place that allow sharing of biometric information like DNA and fingerprints.
France’s interior ministry is expected to unveil soon proposals to widen the use of the technology, with officials keen to be able to use in certain cases such as terrorist attacks and child kidnappings.

"Washington: A majority of the US H-1B employers, including tech giants like Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft, use the temporary work visa programme to pay the migrant workers well below market wages, a new report has claimed.
The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers from countries like India and China in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.
 
Nearly 500,000 migrant workers are employed in the US in the H-1B status.
""Among the top 30 H-1B employers are major US firms including Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, Google, Apple and Facebook. All of them take advantage of program rules in order to legally pay many of their H-1B workers below the local median wage for the jobs they fill,"" said the report released by the Economic Policy Institute.
Authored by Daniel Costa and Ron Hira, the report titled ""H-1B visas and prevailing wage levels"" says 60 per cent of H-1B positions certified by the US Department of Labor (DOL) are assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation.
 
While the H-1B programme rules allow this, the DOL has the authority to change it, but has not, it said.
While over 53,000 employers used the H-1B programme in 2019, the top 30 H-1B employers accounted for more than one in four of all 389,000 H-1B petitions approved by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2019, it said.
Half of the top 30 H-1B employers use an outsourcing business model to provide staff for third-party clients, rather than employing H-1B workers directly to fill a special need at the company that applies for the visa, the report said.
 
The report alleged that major US-based technology firms that hire H-1B workers directly, rather than contract them out to third-party employers, had significant shares of their certified H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2, the two lowest wage levels in fiscal 2019, both of which are below the local median wage.
""Until now, much of the public discourse and proposals for reforming H-1B have focused on rules that would constrain the practices of these outsourcing companies,"" the report said.
But researches reveal that many firms that employ H-1B workers directly, including some of the biggest names in the technology industry such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Qualcomm, Salesforce and Uber, pay a large share of their H-1B workers at one of the two lowest wage levels, Level 1 or Level 2.
 
In addition, these direct-hire firms also hire many H-1B workers on a contract basis through outsourcing firms, it added.
Microsoft, the seventh-largest H-1B employer in 2019, assigned one-third (35 per cent) of its positions on Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) as Level 1 and two-fifths (42 per cent) as Level 2. In total, Microsoft assigned more than three-quarters (77 per cent) of its H-1B positions as Level 1 or Level 2, a wage level below the local median wage.
Microsoft assigned only 18 per cent of its positions as Level 3 (the median) wage, and a mere three per cent as Level 4, the only above-median wage level.
 
Amazon, which appears twice in the H-1B top 30, as ""Amazon.com Services"" (no. 4 among the biggest H-1B employers) and ""Amazon Web Services"" (no. 27), also assigned the vast majority of its H-1B positions at one of the two lowest wage levels.
According to the report, Amazon.com Services assigned 34 per cent of its H-1B positions as Level 1 and 51 per cent as Level 2, for a total of 86 per cent of all positions certified.
Amazon Web Services assigned 47 per cent of its H-1B workers as Level 1 and 36 per cent as Level 2. Combined, Amazon.com Services and Amazon Web Services had 12,428 positions certified at Level 1 or 2, for a total of 85 per cent certified at a wage level below the median. Only one in eight (1,684) were certified at or above the 50th percentile (Level 3 or Level 4), it said.
 
Apple, eleventh on the list, assigned 558 of its H-1B positions (two per cent) as Level 1 and one-third (32 per cent) as Level 2, for a combined total of 34 per cent at Levels 1 and 2. Apple assigned 32 per cent as Level 3 and 34 per cent as Level 4.
Google, ranked the fifth-largest H-1B employer, had 9,085 H-1B positions certified by the DOL in fiscal 2019. It assigned less than half of one per cent of its certified H-1B jobs as Level 1 and 54 per cent as Level 2. Only 37 per cent of Google's jobs were certified at or above the median wage, the report said.
 
Facebook assigned only one position as Level 1 and 10 per cent of its 6,118 total H-1B positions as Level 2. Twenty-five per cent were certified at Level 3 and 16 per cent at Level 4. Nearly half (49 per cent) of Facebook's H-1B positions were certified at a wage established by an alternative wage survey, making it difficult to assess its H-1B wage distribution, it said.
Uber, the 29th-ranked H-1B employer in 2019, had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by the DOL. Less than one per cent was assigned as Level 1 and just over half (53 per cent) as Level 2. Just over one-third were assigned as Level 3 and 13 per cent as Level 4.
 
While Uber had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by DOL and hired 1,160 H-1B workers in 2019, in the same year, it made headlines by laying off 400 employees.
The report claims that the top 30 H-1B employers are in fact hiring H-1B workers to fill a very large number of routine (Levels 1 and 2) positions that require relatively little experience and ordinary skills.

"Raipur: The Chhattisgarh government has launched a web portal for home delivery of liquor in green zones of the state to avoid crowding at wine shops during the coronavirus-enforced lockdown, an official said on Tuesday. 
The portal has been named after the state-run CSMCL (Chhattisgarh State Marketing Corporation Limited), which controls the sale of liquor in the state, a public relations department official here said.
 
The liquor shops, which were closed since March 23, opened from Monday across the state, except in the COVID-19 containment zones and shopping malls, following the Centres decision to ease some curbs during the lockdown.  But, a large number of people queued up outside liquor outlets in the state capital Raipur and other districts, defying the physical distancing norms.
“The state government has given permission for online sale of liquor so that crowding at wine shops can be discouraged,” the official said.
People can book orders directly through the CSMCL website or its mobile app available on Play Store.  However, the home delivery facility will not be available in Raipur and Korba districts which are not classified as green zones, the official said.
 
The Centre has classified districts as red, orange and green zones based on the COVID-19 risk profiling.
People will have to register their mobile number, Aadhaar number and address to place an order online, which will be confirmed through an OTP (one time password).  A customer can order up to 5,000 ml of liquor at a time for home delivery, the official said, adding that the delivery charge is Rs 120.

"Higher education in the US is expensive and has led to crippling financial debt for a lot of youngsters—so much so that one of the main campaign promises of the erstwhile presidential election candidate Bernie Sanders was to waive student loans. So, when students who've paid a bomb for the famed campus experience at premier universities were sent home to learn online during the coronavirus pandemic, they didn't feel they got their money's worth.
Now, students at more than 25 US universities are filing lawsuits against their schools demanding partial refunds on tuition and campus fees, saying they’re not getting the calibre of education they were promised.
 
The suits say students should pay lower rates for the portion of the term that was offered online, arguing that the quality of instruction is far below the classroom experience.
Colleges, though, reject the idea that refunds are in order. Students are learning from the same professors who teach on campus, officials have said, and they’re still earning credits toward their degrees. 
Grainger Rickenbaker, 21, who filed a class-action lawsuit against Drexel University in Philadelphia, said there's little interaction with students or professors and some classes are being taught almost entirely through recorded videos, with no live lecture or discussion.
 
Other students report similar experiences elsewhere. A complaint against the University of California, Berkeley, says some professors are simply uploading assignments, with no video instruction at all. A case against Vanderbilt University says class discussion has been stymied and the “quality and academic rigor of courses has significantly decreased.”
In a case against Purdue University, a senior engineering student said the closure has prevented him from finishing his senior project, building an airplane. “No online course can simulate the applicable, real-world experience” he hoped to gain from the project, the complaint says.
 
Class-action lawsuits demanding tuition refunds have been filed against at least 26 colleges, targeting prestigious private universities, including Brown, Columbia and Cornell, along with big public schools, including Michigan State, Purdue and the University of Colorado, Boulder.
Some of the suits draw attention to schools’ large financial reserves, saying colleges are unfairly withholding refunds even while they rest on endowments that often surpass USD 1 billion.
Several colleges declined to comment on the lawsuits, but some said students have continued to get what they paid for.
 
Ken McConnellogue, a spokesman for the University of Colorado, said it’s disappointing that people have been so quick to file lawsuits only weeks into the pandemic. He said the suits appear to be driven by a small number of “opportunistic” law firms.
Lawyers representing students, however, say the refunds are a matter of fairness.
“You cannot keep money for services and access if you aren’t actually providing it,” said Roy Willey, a lawyer for the Anastopoulo Law Firm in South Carolina, which is representing students in more than a dozen cases. “If we’re truly going to be all in this together, the universities have to tighten their belts and refund the money back to students and families who really need it.”
 
Willey said his office has received hundreds of inquiries from students looking to file suits, and his firm is looking into dozens of possible cases. Other firms taking on similar cases say they’re also seeing a wave of demand from students and parents who say they deserve refunds.
Along with tuition, the cases also seek refunds for fees that students paid to access gyms, libraries, labs and other buildings that are now closed. All told, the complaints seek refunds that could add up to several thousand dollars per student at some schools.
 
Scores of schools have returned portions of housing and dining fees, but few if any have agreed to return any share of tuition.
At the University of Chicago, hundreds of students signed a letter saying they will refuse to pay this term’s tuition, which was due April 29, unless the school reduces tuition by 50% and keeps it at that level during the crisis.
The lawsuits ask courts to answer a thorny question that has come to the fore as universities shift classes online: whether there’s a difference in value between online instruction and the traditional classroom.
 
Willey adds that colleges themselves often charge lower rates for online classes, which he says is a reflection of their value.

"Rio De Janeiro: Rarely have two words ignited such a firestorm of controversy.
""So what?"" said Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday when a journalist asked him about the fact that more than 5,000 Brazilians had died of the coronavirus.
 
The far-right leader's off-the-cuff comment has been sparking anger ever since, with governors, politicians, healthcare professionals and media figures all weighing in to express their outrage at his lack of empathy.
Bolsonaro is no stranger to controversy. But his latest remark sparked such a fury because Brazil is facing a seemingly uncontrollable outbreak of the disease and is still several weeks away from the peak of the pandemic, with a death toll that threatens to surpass even the most dire predictions.
There have been more than 91,000 officially confirmed cases so far but scientists warn the real figure could be 15 to 20 times higher.
 
With a death toll that has already topped 6,300, the giant South American country is facing as grim a scenario as Italy or the United States.
""So what? I'm sorry. What do you want me to do?"" Bolsonaro said Tuesday when questioned about his country passing the 5,000-death mark, more than China. He joked that even though his middle name is Messias, or Messiah, ""I don't do miracles.""
Wilson Witzel, the governor of Rio de Janeiro state, called the president's remarks ""absolutely unacceptable.""
With his own state on the verge of a public health meltdown, Witzel slammed the president for ""being ironic about the deaths"" rather than ""being a leader at such a moment.""
 
""Do your job,"" he said on Twitter Wednesday, the day when the pro-gun president was training at a target range, far from the woes of Brazil's 210 million citizens.
'Brasilia bubble'
Joao Doria, governor of Sao Paulo state which is also on the frontlines of the battle against the coronavirus with more than 2,500 deaths already, replied furiously to Bolsonaro in the capital Brasilia.
""Get out of your Brasilia bubble,"" he retorted, urging Bolsonaro to visit hospitals ""in this country which is crying for its dead and infected.""
 
Unlike many other heads of state, the Brazilian leader has not been seen in any hospitals nor has he expressed much solidarity with victims of the disease, bereaved families or healthcare staff who have condemned the lack of ventilators or beds.
The head of the doctors' union in Sao Paulo, Eder Gatti, called on television for ""a more serious attitude from the president of the republic.""
Bolsonaro ""shows very little sensitivity to the tragedies that the families of those directly affected by the pandemic are going through,"" said Lucio Renno, director of the Institute of Political Science at Brasilia University.
 
""His style is the iron fist, to be hard rather than to show solidarity or empathy,"" he told AFP.
It is a style that inevitably draws comparison with Bolsonaro's own role model, US President Donald Trump.
That type of reaction is ""shocking for a large part of the population"" and ""reinforces the idea for a good part of the elites and for the Brazilian people that he is not fit to govern,"" Renno said.
Miriam Leitao, an op-ed writer at the daily O Globo, wrote on Thursday that with his ""So what?"" Bolsonaro had ""renounced the presidency.""
 
""Anyone who shows such contempt for his own people can no longer be president,"" she wrote.
'Judged by history'
In a tactic he has honed since becoming president, Bolsonaro quickly went on the offensive in the face of criticism from the governors and mayors, whom the Supreme Court has granted the power to call the shots in the fight against the pandemic.
""Ask Joao Doria or (Bruno) Covas [the mayor of Sao Paulo] why people continue to die even when they have taken such restrictive measures,"" said the president.
 
""They are the ones who should have the answers, you can't pin that on me.""
Nevertheless the press on Friday blamed the spike in infections and death on Bolsonaro, who has encouraged people to go out to work to prevent an economic crash and whose most fervent supporters have taken to the streets to protest against lockdown orders.
Bolsonaro's ""So what?"" has ""underscored how little importance he has attached to the situation,"" said political analyst Andre Pereira Cesar.
""If the president does not assume a wartime leadership stance against the virus he will be judged harshly -- by history and by voters,"" he warned.

"Friends and foes
BJP leader Subramanian Swamy and TV news anchor Arnab Goswami have little in common but they have had a blow-cold-blow-hot relationship with Sonia Gandhi. In 1998-99, when Sonia formally entered politics and Goswami was a beat reporter with a prominent TV news channel, he was often spotted at 24, Akbar Road, or outside 10, Janpath. On one occasion, Sonia stopped abruptly to give Goswami a soundbite, a first for any news channel. For months Goswami gushed and seldom missed an opportunity to say “hi” to madam. In 2014, he managed a long interview with Rahul Gandhi, which subsequently damaged Rahul’s reputation as a serious politician. Congress sources insist the interview materialised, courtesy Priyanka Gandhi who offered Goswami “chai-pakoda” during the rainy season at her New Delhi residence. Goswami’s recent diatribe against Sonia, therefore, surprised and shocked 10, Janpath.
 
Subramnian Swamy has been both friend and foe to both Sonia and Goswami. Swamy teamed up with Sonia and Jayalalithaa to bring down the Atal Behari Vajpayee regime and caused irreparable damage to his rapport with both ladies. Incidentally, along with Raj Thackeray, Swamy holds the distinction of taming Goswami on air. When Republic TV was launched, Swamy wrote to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting taking exception to the usage 'Republic' for a commercial venture by Arnab. Swamy said that under the Emblems and Names Act, 1950, certain names and emblems such as 'Republic' are prohibited from use for professional and commercial purposes.
 
Manmohan dazed?
Sonia Gandhi has set up a consultative panel to respond to Narendra Modi government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. However, Dr Manmohan Singh, who confers with Rahul Gandhi, P. Chidambaram, Jairam Ramesh and other members of the panel, is finding the video-conference meetings problematic. Often, he misses out on what others are saying. Panel members say the former prime minister looks dazed. But wife Gursharan Kaur insists Manmohan looks forward to the meeting every day.
Shivraj’s dubious choices
The recent Cabinet expansion conducted by Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan disappointed many. About a dozen BJP hopefuls had reportedly parked themselves in Bhopal even though the state capital was a coronavirus hotspot. There were reports that the state garage requisitioned 12 cars but the move was shelved and only five ministers made it. Three former state health ministers, Narottam Mishra, Tulsi Silawat and Kamal Patel (he was minister in charge of medical education), made it without anyone asking why the MP health infrastructure was so weak. The three BJP ministers are not considered personally loyal to Chouhan while the two Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalists are non-MLAs. Given the uncertainly over the coronavirus, many wonder how Chouhan would ensure Assembly by-polls within six months. MP does not have a second house or legislative council.
 
Mishra has in the past been accused of “paid news” during the 2008 Assembly polls. The Election Commission unanimously asked for Mishra’s disqualification but the Delhi high Court set aside the disqualification.
Varun’s dream
For the discerning viewer, Varun Gandhi’s Twitter timeline showering fulsome praise on prime minister Narendra Modi’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is not without significance. Varun tries to draw Modi’s attention at a time when the buzz is that Jyotiraditya Scindia is set to join the Union cabinet. A Gandhi surname and a series of uninterrupted electoral successes have not bolstered Varun’s chances in the Modi government even though his mother is no longer a minister. Is the PM paying attention to Varun’s subtext? Doesn't appear so.
 
Caste in stone
A religious figure is supposed to renounce worldly considerations like caste, sub-caste, etc. But supporters of a CM of a northern state are reportedly working on a strategy to regroup former bureaucrats, academicians, intellectuals, media and others on a caste-based platform. The idea is not new: Chandrashekhar, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, Digvijaya Singh and Rajnath Singh's camp followers tried a similar tactic without success.
Trouble for Shashi Tharoor
MP Shashi Tharoor found himself in a bit of a spot after he announced with fanfare an online meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on information technology. Apparently, Tharoor, a former Union minister of state and a UN official, hurriedly made the announcement after a cursory conversation with Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla. The Lok Sabha secretariat communicated to the speaker that rules to switch over to online meetings have not been approved. The speaker’s office then informed Tharoor that having a meeting of parliamentary panels via video-conferencing will violate the confidentiality clause. A volte-face followed.

"New Delhi: Most mobile applications that track the spread of COVID-19 require access to users’ personal data, but only a handful indicate the data would be anonymous, encrypted and secured, according to a study by Indian-origin researchers in the US.
Professor Masooda Bashir and doctoral student Tanusree Sharma from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign analysed 50 COVID-19-related apps available in the Google Play store for their access to users’ personal data and their privacy protections.
 
The researchers noted that it is disconcerting that these apps are continuously collecting and processing highly sensitive and personally identifiable information, about health, location and direct identifiers like name, age, email address and voter or national identification of a user.
“Governments’ use of such tracking technology—and the possibilities for how they might use it after the pandemic—is chilling to many,” the researchers wrote in the study published in the journal Nature Medicine.
“Notably, surveillance mapping through apps will allow governments to identify people’s travel paths and their entire social networks,” they noted.
 
The researchers explained that functionalities of the COVID-related apps developed around the world include live maps and updates of confirmed cases, real-time location-based alerts, systems for monitoring home isolation and quarantine, direct reporting to the government of symptoms, and education about COVID-19.
Some also offer monitoring of vital signs, virtual medical consultations and community-driven contact tracing, the said.
Of the 50 apps the researchers evaluated, 30 require users’ permission to access data from their mobile devices such as contacts, photos, media, files, location data, the camera.
 
These 30 apps also require the device’s ID, call information, Wi-Fi connection, microphone, network access, the Google service configuration, and the ability to change network connectivity and audio settings, according to the study.
Some of the apps, the researchers said, state they will collect users’ age, email address, phone number and postal code; the device’s location, unique identifiers, mobile IP address and operating system; and the types of browsers used on the device.
Only 16 of the apps indicated such data will be anonymous, encrypted, secured and reported only in aggregate form, they said.
 
Of the apps sampled in the study, 20 were issued by governments, health ministries and other such official sources.
The researchers acknowledged that mass surveillance measures may be necessary to contain the spread of the virus.
“Health care providers must absolutely use whatever means are available to save lives and confine the spread of the virus,” they wrote in the journal.
However, the researchers added that it is up to the rest, especially those in the field of information privacy and security, to ask the questions needed to protect the right to privacy.

"Chennai: “I have had no income since the lockdown began and I have no money left. I have absolutely no idea as to how I will survive this,” said Neelavathi.
As coronavirus victim tales go, this narrative is not entirely a unique one. Neelavathi’s trade, like most other trades, has been dealt a mortal blow, rendering her penniless.
 
But unlike other daily wage earners, who have social support systems, Neelavathi has no one to tell her story to. She’s a commercial sex worker (CSW). Though the problems she mentions are similar to anybody else’s -- no transport, long queues at shops and police chasing her away in the street -- her lack of work is unique. Not only can she not work from home, there’s no place where her clients can reach her.
On a normal day, Neelavathi steps out for work around 10 am and is back home by around 5 pm. She is one of the CSWs engaged to a ‘house’ in Moolakadi, where she is paid Rs 300 for every client she services. At times she may go out with a client to a lodge or a guest house and make Rs 1000 or more. But that happens rarely.
 
Whatever it is, on an average she used to make Rs 500 per day, which was just enough to feed her two children and her. Since she commutes by bus and autorickshaw, the lockdown has left her immobile, confined to her house.
Besides, she has another worry: She has run out of condoms. As a member of the Red Hills Thai Vizhuthugal Nala Sangam, a community-based organisation (CBO) of CSWs, she’s acutely aware of the need for condoms and regularly visits Red Hills to collect her quota of prophylactics.
The president of Red Hills Thai, Poongodi, said the lockdown came out of the blue. After the coronavirus scare began, at an annual meeting of the collective recently, they had discussed the precautions to be taken against the virus. But the lockdown caught them unawares.
 
The CBO has about 1300 members, all of them CSWs. Many of the women often turn to Poongodi for help but this time the CBO is not equipped to give them any.
The president of the Namakkal District Thai Vizhuthugal Women’s Trust, Geetanjali, put out a message on her Facebook page on April 4 seeking help for the members of her trust, many of whom were going without food.
She said among her members were women who lived below the poverty line and those afflicted by HIV.
She told Deccan Chronicle that many of her members were having just a single meal a day and had no money for other basic needs. Some of the women were living alone with no family support and their plight was the worst, she said.
 
The Nammakkal-based CBO has about 1,500 members, living in villages around the town. Geethanjali fears that the coronavirus crisis might lead to a spread of HIV.
How so? She explained that CSWs pushed to the brink are at risk of giving in to sexual demands in lieu of minor financial or material favours in this time of distress and may thus indulge in risky behaviour due to the lackc of a prophylactic.
Agreeing with her, A J Hariharan of the Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO) said CSWs were primarily responsible for containing the spread of HIV in the country in the past. Hariharan, who has been into AIDS/HIV prevention work since the early 1990s, said it was due to the insistence of these women on use of condoms that stopped the HIV infection.
 
Hariharan said there are 6,300 CSWs in Chennai alone and about 90,000 in the whole of Tamil Nadu. All of them have been hit by the lockdown. Even before the coronavirus, many of them lived in abject poverty. Now the loss of livelihood has affected them so badly they cry on the phone while asking for help.
“We have a stomach to feed,” says Latha, who has never faced a situation like this in her six-year career as a CSW.  She has two children to take care of. Normally she would earn about Rs 1000 a day, serving an average of three clients. She used to work from 11 am to 5.30 pm at a ‘house’ near Moolakadi.
 
Latha has not stepped out of street in Vyasarapadi since the lockdown began. But she has found an alternative career to make money from her house. She has started making tea and selling it on the street. She makes about Rs 100 a day. “Something is better than nothing,” she says.

Whatever it is, on an average she used to make Rs 500 per day, which was just enough to feed her two children and her. Since she commutes by bus and autorickshaw, the lockdown has left her immobile, confined to her house.
Besides, she has another worry: She has run out of condoms. As a member of the Red Hills Thai Vizhuthugal Nala Sangam, a community-based organisation (CBO) of CSWs, she’s acutely aware of the need for condoms and regularly visits Red Hills to collect her quota of prophylactics.
The president of Red Hills Thai, Poongodi, said the lockdown came out of the blue. After the coronavirus scare began, at an annual meeting of the collective recently, they had discussed the precautions to be taken against the virus. But the lockdown caught them unawares.
 
The CBO has about 1300 members, all of them CSWs. Many of the women often turn to Poongodi for help but this time the CBO is not equipped to give them any.
The president of the Namakkal District Thai Vizhuthugal Women’s Trust, Geetanjali, put out a message on her Facebook page on April 4 seeking help for the members of her trust, many of whom were going without food.
She said among her members were women who lived below the poverty line and those afflicted by HIV.
She told Deccan Chronicle that many of her members were having just a single meal a day and had no money for other basic needs. Some of the women were living alone with no family support and their plight was the worst, she said.
 
The Nammakkal-based CBO has about 1,500 members, living in villages around the town. Geethanjali fears that the coronavirus crisis might lead to a spread of HIV.
How so? She explained that CSWs pushed to the brink are at risk of giving in to sexual demands in lieu of minor financial or material favours in this time of distress and may thus indulge in risky behaviour due to the lackc of a prophylactic.
Agreeing with her, A J Hariharan of the Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO) said CSWs were primarily responsible for containing the spread of HIV in the country in the past. Hariharan, who has been into AIDS/HIV prevention work since the early 1990s, said it was due to the insistence of these women on use of condoms that stopped the HIV infection.
 
Hariharan said there are 6,300 CSWs in Chennai alone and about 90,000 in the whole of Tamil Nadu. All of them have been hit by the lockdown. Even before the coronavirus, many of them lived in abject poverty. Now the loss of livelihood has affected them so badly they cry on the phone while asking for help.
“We have a stomach to feed,” says Latha, who has never faced a situation like this in her six-year career as a CSW.  She has two children to take care of. Normally she would earn about Rs 1000 a day, serving an average of three clients. She used to work from 11 am to 5.30 pm at a ‘house’ near Moolakadi.
 
Latha has not stepped out of street in Vyasarapadi since the lockdown began. But she has found an alternative career to make money from her house. She has started making tea and selling it on the street. She makes about Rs 100 a day. “Something is better than nothing,” she says.

"San Francisco: Snapchat on Wednesday became the latest social network moving to curb the reach of US President Donald Trump, claiming the president has been inciting “racial violence.”
The youth-focused social network said it would no longer promote Trump on its Discover platform for recommended content.
 
“We will not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice by giving them free promotion on Discover,” a statement from Snapchat said.
The move came days after Twitter took an unprecedented stand by hiding a Trump post it said promoted violence, heating up the White House war with Silicon Valley and social media.
Snapchat parent Snap chief executive Evan Spiegel over the weekend sent a lengthy memo to employees condemning what he saw as a legacy of racial injustice and violence in the US.
Snapchat will not promote accounts in the US that are linked to people who incite racial violence on or off the messaging platform, according Spiegel.
 
“Every minute we are silent in the face of evil and wrongdoing we are acting in support of evildoers,” Spiegel wrote as companies responded to the outrage over the police killing of a black man in Minnesota.
“I am heartbroken and enraged by the treatment of black people and people of color in America.”
The Discover feature at Snapchat is a curated platform on which the California-based company gets to decide what it recommends to users.
No longer recommended         
Trump’s account remains on the platform, it will just no longer be recommended viewing, according to Snapchat.
 
“We will make it clear with our actions that there is no gray area when it comes to racism, violence, and injustice—and we will not promote it, nor those who support it, on our platform,” Spiegel said in the memo.
Snapchat is particularly popular with young internet users, claiming that about half of the US “Generation Z” population tapping into news through its Discover feature.
“There are plenty of debates to be had about the future of our country and the world,” Spiegel said.
“But there is simply no room for debate in our country about the value of human life and the importance of a constant struggle for freedom, equality, and justice.”
 
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale denounced the move, claiming that “Snapchat is trying to rig the 2020 election, illegally using their corporate funding to promote Joe Biden and suppress President Trump.”
Parscale said in a statement: “Snapchat hates that so many of their users watch the president’s content and so they are actively engaging in voter suppression... If you’re a conservative, they do not want to hear from you, they do not want you to vote. They view you as a deplorable and they do not want you to exist on their platform.”
 
Facebook looks away               
The move by Twitter last week prompted an angry response by Trump, who within days signed an executive order calling for heightened government oversight of social platforms.
Trump accuses the platforms of “censorship” and limiting “free speech,” but his critics say the president has distorted the interpretation of those terms and is himself seeking to regulate online content.
In contrast to Twitter and Snapchat, Facebook has defended his decision not to interfere with posts by Trump.
 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated his position in a call with employees this week, according to reports, despite criticism of the Facebook policy by civil rights activists.
The coronavirus pandemic has put an abrupt stop to traditional US political means of courting young voters—forcing presidential candidates to turn to Snapchat instead.
The photo-sending app that boasts 229 million users—better known for filters that turn your face into a puppy or a vampire—is a new battlefield for opponents Trump and Biden, both of whom are in their 70s.
 
Last month, Ken Farnaso, the Trump campaign deputy press secretary, told AFP that Snapchat was an important element of the re-election effort and that the Republican was ahead of Biden on the platform.
“It’s clear that we’re wiping the floor with Biden’s campaign,” Farnaso said of the Snapchat effort.

"Ever since Doordarshan announced the re-telecast of some of their iconic TV shows, the actors and producers of the said shows have been at loggerheads.
The decision to air 11 popular shows from the 80s and 90s was taken amidst the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 .
 
The national broadcaster has recorded an all-time high audience as the channel ever since has registered a 650 per cent growth in its viewership.
According to BARC India, the first four shows of Ramanand Sagar’s 'Ramayana' garnered 170 million impressions and DD National became the most-watched channel across the country.
This was followed by the re-runs of classics such as 'Byomkesh Bakshi', 'Shaktimaan', 'Buniyaad', 'Circus', 'Dekh Bhai Dekh', 'Alif Laila', 'Chanakya', 'Upanishad Ganga' and 'The Jungle Book', which became equally popular in the first week and even attracted several sponsors.
 
Due for their diligence
This rekindled popularity has once again drawn the attention to many seasoned yet forgotten actors who had become household names when their shows aired for the first time.
So it’s hardly surprising that some of them are now demanding a royalty from the profits of this re-telecast. 'Byomkesh Bakshi' actor 'Sunil Sinha', in a Facebook post, wrote that the channel and producer should give royalty money to the actors.
“When the government has decided to re-telecast the show, the channel and producer will make money. So when the producer is getting extra money, why not the actors and technicians who have worked hard on the show?” the actor asks.
 
Similarly, Dipika Chikhlia, who played Sita in the epic 'Ramayana' opposite Arun Govil’s Ram, feels that the cast of the show should be respected for their contributions.
“Money doesn’t harm anybody and I would have liked to see the profits shared with the actors as well,” says the actress. She also adds that the actors of the iconic mythological show weren’t duly paid well even when the show was shot.
“Everyone knows when the Ramayana was made, we were paid peanuts. It would have been really nice if we were shown some kind of appreciation with the makers sharing the profits with us,” she says.
 
Trickle down theory
Veteran actress Pallavi Joshi, who played an integral part in the popular 80s show 'Buniyaad', says that India should have adapted the concept of extending royalty to actors, a practice common in the US.
“Actors are actually forced to do a lot of work that they don’t wish to because of not having royalties in place, so it should have been introduced long back,” says the actress.
Mita Vashisht, who shared the screen with Shah Rukh Khan and Ashutosh Gowarikar in the iconic show 'Circus', adds that the industry is not mature enough to acknowledge the efforts of all involved.
 
“It is the actors who have made these shows popular. In a healthy industry, some percentage of royalty should be given to everyone. But our industry is not thoughtful in terms of royalties,” says the 'Dil Se' actress, who feels that everyone needs to respect the actors and technicians’ contributions.
Producers differ
But the producers of these iconic shows, have a parallel view on the matter. For instance, 'Shaktimaan' actor Mukesh Khanna, who is also the producer of the show, clarifies that actors sign a contract agreeing that they will not claim any money or royalty upon the re-telecast of the show, which means that they have no legal claim.
 
“It is not done. Certain things are contractual and actors have to abide by it. The producer can recover the money by all means. As an actor, I would say it sounds good. But as a producer, I will be making money from everywhere,” says the actor who is also a part of the on-going epic show 'Mahabharata' on DD.
“Besides, most of them are seasoned actors and they are doing pretty well in the industry, so why to give them royalty?” he says, refuting the claims made by actors seeking a share of the pie.
Joshi however disagrees with Khanna and feels the claims made by the actors are valid. “The channel hasn’t produced any show, and the effort made by the producer during a re-run is zero. So when the producer is getting the extra money then he should distribute a percentage of it to the actors and technicians who are at home in these difficult times and struggling to put food on the table for their children,” she says.

"New York: A tech-focused civil liberties group on Tuesday sued to block President Donald Trump’s executive order that seeks to regulate social media, saying it violates the First Amendment and puts curbs on free speech.
Trump’s order, signed last week, could allow more lawsuits against internet companies like Twitter and Facebook for what their users post, tweet and stream.
 
The order was more political than substantive, with many experts questioning whether it was constitutional. The president aimed to rally his supporters after Twitter put fact checks on two of his tweets. Trump, without evidence, has long accused tech companies of being biased against conservatives.
The order targets current law — you may have heard recent references to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — that protects internet companies from lawsuits. They can’t be sued for hosting videos and posts from users, or for moderating their services, with some exceptions.
 
In its suit, the Center for Democracy and Technology said that Trump’s executive order violates the First Amendment because it attacks Twitter for putting the fact checks on the president’s tweets, which CDT said is Twitter’s right as a private company. More broadly, the order is trying to curb speech of all online platforms and people “by demonstrating the willingness to use government authority to retaliate against those who criticize the government,” CDT said.
“The government cannot and should not force online intermediaries into moderating speech according to the president’s whims,” said Alexandra Givens, CDT’s CEO, in an emailed statement. The organization filed the federal suit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.
 
There was pushback against Trump’s order from various sources. Tech industry groups, unsurprisingly, said it was bad for innovation and speech. Civil rights and libertarian organizations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also criticized Trump’s order.

"Hyderabad: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has notified the state government to extend the lockdown in the state capital till the end of May.
Covid-19 cases have been increasing at alarming pace in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits. Another 30 cases were reported on Friday. Mayor Bonthu Rammohan puts the blame on the people and said if they do not cooperate with the government and observe the lockdown strictly, it would be extended until the coronavirus cases reach zero.
 
Rammohan said chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao has taken a very serious view of people violating the lockdown protocol and may come up with stringent rules after the Cabinet meeting scheduled on April 19. He noted that though about 45,000 vehicles have been seized for violating lockdown rules, people were still moving about on the roads using fake passes.
""We have been keeping strict vigil only in the containment zones by trusting the others. The government is clueless about the number of coronavirus positive cases in the remaining areas. If the public movement is not curtailed and if they do not cooperate with the government, they are risking their lives and those of others,” he said.
 
He cited other cases, one of an onion seller in Rajendernagar who came in contact with a Nizamuddin Markaz returnee and interacted with 45 others and later tested positive and that of a migrant who travelled in a train with Markaz returnees and was asymptomatic but one of his contacts, his landlady, died.
“We are not sure whether a 14-day quarantine is enough to contain Covid-19. I advise people to quarantine for 28 days even though they have tested negative,"" Rammohan said.
He said May would be favourable to contain Covid-19 and the arrival of the monsoon in June could complicate the situation as other contagious diseases spread with the rains.
 
""It is not easy to manage a city with a huge population. The public should abide by the law to contain the deadly virus,"" he said.
He urged residents to click pictures of those who violate social distancing norms at supermarkets, meat shops and other markets and post them on social media platforms. The corporation would seal all the shops for the lockdown period, he said.

"New Delhi: Getting unwarranted video call requests at odd hours and comments on social media photos by male colleagues who are not friends are among issues of sexual harassment women working from home during the nationwide lockdown have faced, organisations working against cyber harassment said.
The coronavirus-triggered lockdown has posed a lot of challenges for women professionals especially, as they struggle to manage the work-life balance. In addition, they are also facing sexual harassment online.
 
Many women have approached experts for guidance, unsure of how to raise complaints of sexual harassment in the work-from-home scenario.
“There are no clear guidelines from companies on how work from home should function in an organisation and that confuses women. I have been receiving 4-5 such complaints of harassment everyday ever since the lockdown was imposed,” said Akancha Srivastava, who runs the foundation Akancha Against Harassment, an initiative against cyber harassment.
However, the number of complaints received by the National Commission for Women (NCW) has been low since the lockdown began but those working in the field say that could be because many women do not want to officially complain but wish to consult what they can do on the matter.
 
“During the lockdown, many women are worried about their job security so they are not sure if they should speak up or not. The women have a constant worry that they should not be seen as troublemakers,” Srivastava said.
 “Since we have never experienced absolute work from home before, women are always second-guessing if it was harassment, where does one draw the line, how does one define the body language as offensive or indecent? Male colleagues stalking them on social media or sending friend requests, commenting on their pictures when they are not even friends.
 
“Women are being told to come online at odd hours. These are subtle ways of sexually harassing them,” she said.
Giving examples, Srivastava said one woman had recently received a video call request from her boss at 11 pm for an “urgent matter”, but when she received the call it turned out to be for something that on a regular day would have been easily taken care of over an email.
Srivastava said that with work-from-home, there are bound to be some disruptions and that colleagues should respectfully accept them, but that is not happening. That is causing more stress to women.
 
For example, in a sexist comment, another woman was asked by her boss over video call if she was capable of handling work assigned to her as she seemed “distracted” because of her children who were playing in the background.
Some women have also complained that they find their colleagues inappropriately dressed during virtual meetings and it made them uncomfortable.
The Prohibition of Sexual Harassment Act 2013 (or POSH) was enacted to ensure safe working spaces for women and to build enabling work environments that respect the rights of working women to equality of status and opportunity.
 
It defined a ‘workplace’ as “any place visited by employee arising out of or during the course of employment, including transportation provided by the employer for undertaking such a journey”. As such, while working from home, the home can also be defined as the workplace.
An activist at InfoSec Girls, an organisation educating women on cyber security, said a lot of people don’t report but wish to discuss what they should do when they face sexual harassment.
The activist said there have been times when men either do not realise that women colleagues are also on the call or choose to wilfully ignore it, while passing inappropriate comments.
 
Also, now that everyone is working from home, colleagues have lost sense of propriety about when a female colleague can be contacted. People end calling anytime and begin meetings at odd times. This can make women uncomfortable as they have to balance family life with work, she said.
“When women raise these kinds of concerns, we say, ‘if you feel uncomfortable with any discussion or comment, raise the concern immediately on the call so it does not happen again. If that makes them uncomfortable, then discuss it with the leadership or raise it via the organisation reporting channel’,” she said.
 
Every organisation is supposed to follow the Visakha guidelines on sexual harassment. “There is a proper council that addresses all these concerns. Women can anonymously report the concerns. The council then discusses the concern with person against whom the complaint was raised. If nothing else works out, women can report to local authorities,” she said.

"Bengaluru: In this summer of the coronavirus, who doesn’t have a tale of woe? For farmers it’s all-too familiar a situation: just when the crop is coming to hand, a natural disaster strikes and they are unable to reach the market in time and the produce rots in the field.
For horticulturists, this has been such a time: there’s a severe shortage of summer fruits and vegetables in the cities, but they are unable to market their produce.
 
Amidst this gloom, grape farmers in and around Bengaluru have got together to pull off a miracle. Unobtrusively and unknown to many, hundreds of grape growers have coalesced into a direct marketing movement in and around the city.
By skirting market structures and lockdown barriers, they are reaching resident welfare associations direct and selling their produce straight to the consumer.
This movement was initiated by the University of Agriculture Sciences (UAS) Alumni Association to help grape farmers find a market in this corona-hit summer.
 
Look at the difference this is making: while the government-run procurement agency HOPCOMS picks up an average of 2-3 tons of grapes per day from farmers, the direct marketing initiative is moving 250-300 tons a day.
UAS Alumni Association president Dr K Narayangowda says he never dreamed of such a huge response from the people. 
How it began
Around the time when the coronavirus lockdown was declared, vineyards around Bengaluru were approaching harvest. The country was already in the grip of the coronavirus, and a total shutdown of markets spelt disaster for grape growers.
 
Bengaluru’s vines are not linked to the food processing industry; they sell most of their produce to the consumer. If they are shut out now, the crop would have to be destroyed.
Export to other states was out of the question, not with the transport system down and a lockdown everywhere else too. “We had to find a market right here,” said Narayanagowda.
So 12 days ago, the UAS Alumni Association knit up the farmers into a patchwork collective linked with WhatsApp, and made pitches to a few residents’ association.
 
“To understand the market, we went to the HOPCOMS main centre near Lalbagh. We found HOPCOMS procuring grapes for Rs 45 per kg from the farmer and selling it through its outlet just adjacent to the procurement centre for Rs 115 per kg. We were shocked by the margin it was making,'' Narayanagowda said.
Then they visited farmers in the Kolar and Chikkaballapur region and started working out the cost. Farmers were educated on how to pack them and what time they had to harvest once the order was confirmed and delivery schedules.
 
 “We realised that Rs 55 per kg was an ideal price for farmers and we started reaching out to residents' associations by publicising our WhatsApp number. We landed a first order for 1.5 tons,” says Narayanagowda.
It was a good deal for the consumers: where they had to go to the market and buy grapes at Rs 120 per kg, they were getting the same stuff at their doorstep for no more than Rs 55-60 per kg.
In the next three days, the number of orders just baffled them. “We have a lot of residents' association working with farmers. At Rajarajeshwari Nagar, the Rotary Club president has taken the lead and four sets of farmers are supplying them grapes. At the end of the week, we ended up selling over 250-300 tons per day in Bengaluru alone. Besides learning about the market, many farmers are also directly exploring some of the markets,'' he said.
 
“We learnt a lot of things about grape marketing. In the first place, Bengaluru people were never exposed to quality grapes by traders. Very few had access to quality grapes. Some had given up eating grapes. Now, everyday new grape fans are being added to the list. We are making a database and we’ll launch online marketing by next year,'' says Narayanagowda.
What about mango?
The cooperative is planning to try the grape tactics with mango, which is just beginning to come into the market. The mango market is in a similar situation as grape: it cannot be shipped out of the state.
 
However, the grape tactics did not work with other fruits and vegetables. Tomato is harvested at the same time as grapes but its market is different. Over 80 per cent of tomato grown around Bengaluru goes to the Kissan factory for making sauce. But the since the factory is closed, there was no way farmers could find an alternative market. Traders refused to pick up the excess tomato because prices would crash. So farmers had no choice but to let the produdce rot on the farm.
Though vegetable demand and supply remains the same, the situation is exploited by traders. Citing social distance, they have created distance between product and consumer, driving the prices up. But farmers get no dividend from this.

“We learnt a lot of things about grape marketing. In the first place, Bengaluru people were never exposed to quality grapes by traders. Very few had access to quality grapes. Some had given up eating grapes. Now, everyday new grape fans are being added to the list. We are making a database and we’ll launch online marketing by next year,'' says Narayanagowda.
What about mango?
The cooperative is planning to try the grape tactics with mango, which is just beginning to come into the market. The mango market is in a similar situation as grape: it cannot be shipped out of the state.
 
However, the grape tactics did not work with other fruits and vegetables. Tomato is harvested at the same time as grapes but its market is different. Over 80 per cent of tomato grown around Bengaluru goes to the Kissan factory for making sauce. But the since the factory is closed, there was no way farmers could find an alternative market. Traders refused to pick up the excess tomato because prices would crash. So farmers had no choice but to let the produdce rot on the farm.
Though vegetable demand and supply remains the same, the situation is exploited by traders. Citing social distance, they have created distance between product and consumer, driving the prices up. But farmers get no dividend from this.

"Tipplers in the five southern states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are eagerly awaiting the home delivery of alcohol as Zomato and Swiggy expanded the services launched in Jharkhand last week to Odisha today.
Less than a week after putting ‘wine shops’ in Jharkhand on its platform, Zomato expanded to Bhubaneswar and will soon deliver to other cities such as Rourkela, Balasore, Balangir, Sambalpur, Berhampur and Cuttack. Swiggy said it was starting with Bhubaneswar and Rourkela and would soon serve Cuttack and Berhampur as well.
 
The southward direction that the alcohol delivery services of the apps have taken bring hope to drinkers in the five southern states. While liquor outlets have opened in most places in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Kerala is still holding out.
The state, whose largest source of revenue is alcohol sales, has exercised restraint in opening up its state-owned Beverages Corporation (Bevco) outlets, cautious about triggering a setback to its successfully continuing fight against COVID-19, as people would inevitably crowd the wine shops.
 
To get around the problem, Kerala is launching its own Bevco app called Bev Q. Unlike Swiggy and Zomato that offer home delivery, Bev Q is a mobile virtual queue management app, which will enable the state to reopen liquor outlets while getting the public to adhere to physical distancing norms.
It has even passed the Google test, reports said, paving the way for the app to be listed for download on the Android Play Store.
Nevertheless tipplers would like the option of Swiggy and Zomato home delivery.
How a country coy about liquor allowed home delivery
 
After liquor shops across the country were shut down when the lockdown began on March 25,  as the restrictions were eased recently, the Supreme Court asked states to consider non-direct contact or online sales and home delivery of liquor during the lockdown period to prevent the spread of coronavirus on account of crowding at the shops.
Zomato and Swiggy, which already have a food delivery network in place across the country, then worked with state excise departments to work out the modalities of home delivery. To ensure compliance with safety guidelines as well as the laws on alcohol consumption, the two platforms verify the identity of the buyers to confirm they are not underage.
 
Users are required to upload a valid ID proof to order on the apps, which are later verified by delivery executives at the time of handing over the order. There would also be limits on how many bottles can be purchased, Zomato said.
Swiggy said it was partnering with authorised retailers after validating their licence and other required documents as outlined by the state government. It is also going one step further by getting customers to upload not just valid government ID but also a selfie, which the platform will use for authentication.
 
The company has partnered with HyperVerge to enable AI-face recognition for mandatory age verification and user authentication for alcohol deliveries, it said.

"New Delhi: The Government's mobile app Aarogya Setu, developed for tracking coronavirus patients, has become the world's fastest app to reach 5 crore downloads in just 13 days, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on April 14 appealed to people to download the app.
 
""Telephone took 75 years to reach 50 million users, radio 38 yrs, television 13 yrs, Internet 4 yrs, Facebook 19 months, Pokemon Go 19 days. AarogyaSetu, India's app to fight COVID-19 has reached 50 mn users in just 13 days-fastest ever globally for an App,"" Kant said in his tweet.
The Aarogya Setu app alerts people if any person in their vicinity has tested positive for COVID-19.
District administrations have been asking all educational institutions and government departments to push people to download the app. The more people install the app on their phones, the more effective it becomes at identifying through location data and Bluetooth data, which phones have come into close contact with an infected person.
 
The app accesses data of infected persons from the Ministry of Health and alerts people if they have come into contact with a Covid-19 infected person.
According to sources, Tata Consultancy Services is working on testing the app and some of its other aspects while Tech Mahindra and the Mahindra group is working on the next version of this application leveraging data science and next generation technologies such as machine learning.
Tech Mahindra is also working on expanding the reach of Aarogya Setu to all types of phones. The current version of Aarogya Setu app is fit for use on smartphones only.

"New Delhi: The Indian Army has asked its personnel to use the Covid-19 contact-tracing app Aarogya Setu with caution while following all cyber security precautions.
While urging download of the Aarogya Setu app, it advised personnel to avoid it in office premises, operational areas and sensitive locations. Personnel, veterans and families have been asked to cyber security precautions.
 
Aarogya Setu is a mobile app developed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to help citizens identify their risk of contracting Covid-19.
“Existing cyber security policies on usage of mobile phones must be adhered to by army personnel while using the Aarogya Setu app,” the soldiers were informed, said sources.
The Indian Army has asked its personnel to only switch on the location services and bluetooth features of the Aarogya Setu app while visiting public places, or when they are engaged in managing isolation centres, while on call for COVID-19 related assistance to civil authorities and while out of cantonments or military stations for essential administrative duties.
 
They have been told not to disclose their service identity including rank and appointment. The contact list of the user should not contain any reference to rank appointment or service. Army personnel have been advised to keep their mobile operating systems updated and to install antivirus protection on their cell phones.
The Aarogya Setu app has crossed the 5 crore downloads in just the 13 days since it was launched.
The app uses bluetooth, GPS, algorithms and artificial intelligence to notify users of their risk of catching the COVID-19 infection, by tracing the same data from other users of the app. 
 
The app detects other devices with Aarogya Setu installed that come in the proximity of that phone. GPS tracks the location of the user in real time and bluetooth tracks if and when the user comes in close proximity with someone infected by COVID-19. 
If a user comes into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, they will be notified about it in a few days. The app has access to the Government of India’s database of known cases.

"Weeks after Mukesh Ambani signed a deal between JioMart and Facebook, the self-declared kirana store aggregator has launched its services in 200 cities, including small cities such as Bhatinda, Mysuru and Dehradun, but without taking the neighbourhood stores on board.
A pilot project launched last month in Navi Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan, all suburbs of Mumbai, included kirana stores as well as JioMart’s own warehouses; but now with the national launch, the kirana stores are nowhere in the picture at present.
 
Currently, grocery orders placed on the JioMart website are serviced by Reliance Smart and Fresh stores and Reliance Retail’s Sahakari Bhandar stores, not neighbourhood shops, PTI quoted the financial services company Credit Suisse as saying.
“Just prior to the national launch, Reliance Retail tapped the WhatsApp customer base in the three pilot regions to source orders. In our view, it was just a test phase of integration,” it said.
""The orders were available only for pick-up from nearby kirana stores, whose details were sent to the customer via WhatsApp. However, the national launch, so far, does not have that integration with WhatsApp.”
 
While JioMart claims it will be adding kirana stores shortly on its platform, the question arises whether this is just a test phase to see whether customers will flock to JioMart abandoning their neighbourhood stores.
Even if that is not the case or in the event that the test is not successful and the kirana stores just have to be brought on board, Reliance could use them as mere delivery mules, insisting that the stores stock what Reliance supplies, at the rate it decides.
In an indication of that, Credit Suisse said, “In terms of pricing, Reliance has extended the Smart promise of ‘minimum 5 per cent off on MRP’ to all products on JioMart. The discount is higher on its private label brands, and is competitive to branded products.”
 
So, if it looks like the kirana store aggregator model of JioMart is morphing into a takeover of the grocery market itself, it could very well be the case. Market research firm Bernstein says groceries make up 70 per cent of the Indian retail market, with more than 90 per cent driven by neighbourhood shops. “Organised penetration is less than 10 per cent while online penetration is less than 1 per cent,” it said.
So Reliance’s likely ambition to replace mom and pop stores is pretty much in keeping with what seems to be its monopolistic vision. Case in point, the telecom industry, where Reliance’s free offers and low prices managed to make it the dominant force in a field that earlier had several players.
 
As things stand, supermarket chain D-Mart’s April revenues are down 45 per cent year-on-year, with nearly 50 per cent of its stores shut or having restricted hours of operation. D-Mart is just one example among a vast space being vacated by similar businesses in the grocery market.
These falling revenues are what Reliance aims to mop up with the JioMart network.
“...a pan-India extension of partnerships with mom and pop stores after a successful beta test and ramp-up of this new commerce venture is crucial in Reliance’s grand plan of converting Jio’s 400 million-plus subscribers into customers for its ecommerce and other offerings,” market investment and insights firm CLSA was quoted as saying by PTI.
 
As such, Reliance’s recent partnership with Facebook-owned WhatsApp for JioMart is aimed at converting Jio subscribers into JioMart shoppers.
Eventually, like other online retailers, Reliance could integrate its entire retail offerings, including fashion, lifestyle and consumer electronics, onto one super ecommerce platform and mobile app, rivalling Amazon and Flipkart.
Bernstein in a separate report said as much: “JioMart has seen a 4x rise in online orders from a low base. With its pan India presence, JioMart now directly competes with Amazon and Flipkart in eCommerce.”

"New York: The role of technology in helping push back against the novel coronavirus has been hailed widely. But it also means that people are constantly being watched by entities that can set the tone for public behaviour without giving a shred of consideration to people’s privacy. One of the greatest contemporary thinkers, Noam Chomsky, warns of the consequences of technology being allowed to control our lives in the guise of making our lives easier.
In an interview with AFP, Chomsky talked about how the dystopian reality of digital surveillance is already here.  “There are now companies developing technology which make it possible for the employer ... to look at what's on your computer screen and to check your keystrokes and if you get up and walk away for a minute, they'll send you a warning.”
 
“That's being installed right now.... It's not the future.”
The very things that are convenient are the ones that are invasive, he pointed out. “The so-called Internet of Things is coming along. It's convenient. It means if you're driving home you can turn on the stove — but it also means that that information is going to Google and Facebook, to the government, the American government, the French government, it's an enormous amount of potential control, surveillance and invasion. But this has happened. It's not the future.
 
“If we allow the huge tech companies, the state, to control our life that's what will happen. They'll turn it into something like China, where you have social credit systems and in some cities you get a certain amount of credits, there's face recognition technology all over the place and everything you do gets monitored.
“If you cross the street in the wrong place, you can ... lose some credits, and so on.
“It's not inevitable, just like global warming, that it's going to happen — unless people stop it.”
 
When asked whether the use of surveillance was justified in combating COVID-19, said “It might be — during the period of threat. There's controls needed during wartime, you have rationing. But it doesn't have to be permanent.... 'Yes, we'll let you have this authority now, but it can be revoked at any time.'""
Speaking about other major problems facing humankind, Chomsky said global warming was a greater threat than even the deadly pandemic. . “As severe as this pandemic is, it's not the worst problem. There will be recovery from the pandemic at severe cost ... but there isn't going to be any recovery from the melting of the polar ice caps and the rising of sea levels and the other deleterious effects of global warming,” he said.
 
However, it is evident that the public is either not aware or not bothered to see global warming as a serious enough problem.  
That kind of a public in the US also voted for a leadership that has proven itself wholly unequal to the task of managing the pandemic in the country where more than 100,000 people have died of it . “There's no coherent leadership. It's chaotic. The presidency, the White House, is in the hands of a sociopathic megalomaniac who's interested in nothing but his own power, electoral prospects — doesn't care what happens to the country, the world,” Chomsky said, in scathing criticism of President Donald Trump.
 
Chomsky spelled out how the administration under Trump never even gave the US a chance against COVID-19. “As soon as Trump came in, his first move was to dismantle the entire pandemic prevention machinery. At the start, defunding the Center for Disease Control, which would deal with this. And canceling programs that were working with Chinese scientists to identify potential viruses. So the US was singularly unprepared,” Chomsky said.
He explained the economic model that led to the current situation. “It's a privatised society, very wealthy, with enormous advantages — far more than any other country — but it’s in the stranglehold of private control.
 
“It doesn't have a universal health care system.... It's the ultimate neoliberal system, actually.”
He compared it to Europe, which in “many ways is worse, because the austerity programs just amplify the danger, because of the severe attack on democracy in Europe, the shifting decisions to Brussels....” But he added, “At least it has the residue of some kind of social democratic structure, which provides some support, which is what I think is lacking in the US.”

"This is a piece about a piece I didn’t want to write. And, subsequently, how I wrote about why I didn’t want to write it. On FB. And how that proved I was right in not writing it in the first place. No, I am not Swami Nithyananda writing pseudonymously from Shrikailasa and teleporting this piece to Asian Age via soooperconshussnessss. (Though I do think there is something to the depth of the physics being equal to the length of the geography.) Hear me out.
Just a while ago, a leading vernacular newspaper asked me if I could write a piece on someone I’m related to. A piece about what it was like growing up under his gaze, that kind of thing.
 
The following day, I apologized to them saying I would have to decline. The editor asked me why. I said it seemed unfair on my part to celebrate this person in this manner at a time like this.
She said she understood. But I don't know if she did. She couldn’t possibly have seen the italics in my response. The reason I declined was not because I thought the person was unworthy of celebration. Or that it was inappropriate on my part to celebrate him now.
It was more to do with how we ought to celebrate anyone or anything at all in these times. And by ‘we’, I mean the privileged.
 
Had I written purely about what he was mainly known for, no one would have faulted me. His work is formidable and relevant.
Not enough people knew that he had another side to him, too: social reformer. And that he had defied convention and community, and fought for the rights of, well, let’s just say, the downtrodden.
The right kind of stuff to recall and celebrate, you’d think, when our country’s rich, selfish and entitled are putting up recipes, work-out videos, and sari challenges as the poorest of the poor are dying in ways we can’t imagine.
 
But I still didn't think it was appropriate to write about him.
By writing in a newspaper, something only the privileged (and by that I mean anyone who has footwear, whose three meals a day are assured, has a roof over his head and won’t die of starvation anytime soon) have access to, or can afford, for that matter, I wondered what I would have achieved.
Would I have disturbed the comfortable, as they drank their second dose of filter coffee, paper in hand, their biggest worry being why their bm wasn’t entirely satisfactory? Would I have comforted the disturbed? Not a chance. Which hungry soul’s calloused feet would my piece have applied balm to?
 
Would the man himself be writing were he around now? I think not. He would be out there doing something.
Within minutes of my posting this, predictably, a cloth-bag-brandishing intellectual, the kind that doesn’t normally grace downmarket dives like my page, swooped in.
“Sorry Krishna,” he expounded. (His ilk never just say, they expound, explicate and expatiate.) “I don't buy this writing vs doing dichotomy. That's lazy theorizing. Sometimes, writing is doing. We certainly need to celebrate writers like this relative of yours. The unslippered anyway take comfort in songs while they trudge along the highways, and who knows one of those songs could be his.”
 
These are the actual words of the gent. And I use that term loosely.
He referred to the guest workers as the unslippered. And he actually believed the guest workers, currently dying on railway tracks and in road accidents if hunger, thirst, heat, exhaustion or plain despair hadn’t got to them already, needed songs, ditties and stand-up comedy, perhaps. And poets, writers, composers, filmmakers should busy themselves making inspirational art to save them, soothe them, as the disaster is still ongoing. Because painting, writing and sculpting were doing, too. Why give them rice, dal and water, was his point, when we could give them life-affirming art and literature.
 
It was as if Nero and Marie Antoinette had had a love child.
It’s not the casual callousness of the ones we dismiss as philistines that we need to worry about. It is the pathological lack of empathy on the part of the so-called intellectual class, the lot that has appointed itself caretaker and curator of art and literature, that frightens me.
The funny thing, by which I mean sad, is despite my FB post being about our appalling lack of empathy, even the ‘positive’ responses, from 95% of the folks, were about this relation of mine.
 
All isn’t lost, though. Saw another post on FB, that of a mother congratulating her daughter on her graduation. ‘Hope the future is full of happy surprises, baby girl,’ she said. ‘Waiting to celebrate once the world heals.’

"Chennai: WhatsApp on Tuesday put spokes in the ever-turning wheel of misinformation by restricting forwards to just one chat at a time. The update has come to India first, in an indication of how widely the platform is being used to spread unverified information in the country. It will soon be rolled out globally.
Similarly in August 2018, WhatsApp limited forwarding to five chats after the platform found it was being used extensively in India to spread misinformation, fake news and propaganda.
 
The app, which has 2 billion users worldwide introduced the curbs globally around January 2019. NDTV reported that WhatsApp claimed the restrictions led to a 25 per cent decrease in forwards globally.
The report also cited consulting firm Kantar as having found a 40 per cent increase in WhatsApp usage as COVID-19 began spreading globally. The messaging app owned by Facebook was reported to have made the “greatest gains” in usage among social media apps.
Now, with fake news threatening to derail efforts to combat the deadly coronavirus pandemic, WhatsApp, which has 400 million users in India, has introduced the stricter curbs in the country.
 
However, one can still use the forward option several times to send a message to multiple users or copy a message and paste it to various chats.
To ensure that users got only authoritative information on COVID-19, WhatsApp had recently collaborated with the Government of India to create a chat bot to answer queries.
Earlier, in August, WhatsApp added a ‘Forwarded’ label to messages that were not composed by a close contact of the user.
Last month, the app also took measures to mark certain forward messages as requiring verification, on its beta version. A magnifying lens icon appearing alongside the message prompted users to search online and verify the content. But since the update has not been rolled out for all users, several messages and videos were still being shared without being flagged in any manner.

"Washington: A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a legislation in both the chambers of the US Congress proposing major reforms in skilled non-immigrant visa programmes by giving priority to US-educated foreign technology professionals in issuing H-1B work visas.
The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act, as introduced in House of Representatives and Senate, will require US Citizenship and Immigration Services to prioritise for the first time the annual allocation of H-1B visas.
 
The new system would ensure that the best and brightest students being educated in the United States receive preference for an H-1B visa, including advanced degree holders, those being paid a high wage, and those with valuable skills, proponents of this major legislative reforms said Friday.
In the Senate, it was introduced by Senators Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin. In the House of Representatives, it was introduced by Congressmen Bill Pascrell, Paul Gosar, Ro Khanna, Frank Pallone and Lance Gooden.
The legislation reinstates Congress's original intent in the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes by increasing enforcement, modifying wage requirements and securing protections for both American workers and visa holders, the lawmakers said.
 
The legislation, among other things, explicitly prohibits the replacement of American workers by H-1B or L-1 visa holders, clarifying that working conditions of similarly employed American workers may not be adversely affected by the hiring of an H-1B worker, including H-1B workers who have been placed by another employer at the American worker's worksite.
These provisions address the types of abuses that have been well-documented.
Importantly, the legislation proposes increased crackdown on outsourcing companies that import large numbers of H-1B and L-1 workers for temporary training purposes only to send the workers back to their home countries to do the same job.
 
Specifically, the bill would prohibit companies with more than 50 employees, of which at least half are H-1B or L-1 holders, from hiring additional H-1B employees.
The bill gives the US Department of Labor enhanced authority to review, investigate, and audit employer compliance with programme requirements, as well as to penalise fraudulent or abusive conduct. It requires the production of extensive statistical data about the H-1B and L-1 programs, including wage data, worker education levels, place of employment, and gender.
In addition, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act encompasses several reforms of the L-1 visa programme, including establishment of a wage floor for L-1 workers; authority for the US Department of Homeland Security to investigate, audit, and enforce compliance with L-1 program requirements; assurance that intra-company transfers occur between legitimate branches of a company and don't involve  shell  facilities; and a change to the definition of  specialized knowledge  to ensure that L-1 visas are reserved only for truly key personnel.
 
Asserting that Congress created these programmes to complement America's high-skilled workforce, not replace it, Grassley said that unfortunately, some companies are trying to exploit the programmes by cutting American workers for cheaper labour.
“We need programmes dedicated to putting American workers first. When skilled foreign workers are needed to meet the demands of our labour market, we must also ensure that visa applicants who honed their skills at American colleges and universities are a priority over the importation of more foreign workers. Our bill takes steps to ensure that the programs work for Americans and skilled foreign workers alike,” he said.
 
Reforming the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes is a critical component of fixing the broken immigration system. For years, outsourcing companies have used loopholes in the laws to displace qualified American workers and facilitate the outsourcing of American jobs, Durbin said.
This legislation would end these abuses and protect American and foreign workers from exploitation, Durbin said.
Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna said that American immigrants come to this country with some of the most innovative, transformative ideas this world has ever seen.
 
""If we're going to continue to foster a culture of creativity, we must reform the H-1 and L-1 visa programmes to protect all workers from abuses. Immigrants coming here on H-1B visas have made important contributions to Silicon Valley's leadership in the digital revolution. We want to make sure that talent is coming to the US, but we also want to make sure that it's being done with proper compensation, Khanna said.
Congressman Pallone said that the US must ensure that qualified American workers have access to job opportunities in this country.

Now, with fake news threatening to derail efforts to combat the deadly coronavirus pandemic, WhatsApp, which has 400 million users in India, has introduced the stricter curbs in the country.
 
However, one can still use the forward option several times to send a message to multiple users or copy a message and paste it to various chats.
To ensure that users got only authoritative information on COVID-19, WhatsApp had recently collaborated with the Government of India to create a chat bot to answer queries.
Earlier, in August, WhatsApp added a ‘Forwarded’ label to messages that were not composed by a close contact of the user.
Last month, the app also took measures to mark certain forward messages as requiring verification, on its beta version. A magnifying lens icon appearing alongside the message prompted users to search online and verify the content. But since the update has not been rolled out for all users, several messages and videos were still being shared without being flagged in any manner.

"Saad’s dubious hand
The Tablighi Jamaat’s (TJ) reckless and irresponsible conduct in the current coronavirus outbreak has surprised many within the Muslim community. The Tablighis have largely been an apolitical and disciplined lot with a penchant for holding large conclaves where after-life matters are deliberated and discussed. However, of late, TJ has been witnessing an intense power struggle between its chief Maulana Saad Kandhlawi and a powerful lobby consisting of the ‘shoura’ (executive council).
 
Saad, a great-grandson of TJ founder Maulana Illyas, reportedly wanted to be one-up on his rivals and ignored saner voices to defer the Delhi-Nizamuddin congregation. Instead, his supporters ensured crowd mobilisation from southern states like Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Kerala, with disastrous consequences. Maulana Saad's role in the TJ headquarters sharing a wall with the Nizamuddin police station has been as dubious. The police reportedly were regular beneficiaries of food and other goodies coming from the TJ office which blurred their vision to act swiftly and decisively.
 
The rise of Rohan Gupta
After successfully convincing the grand old party to begin working through video-conferencing (something that Rahul Gandhi tried and failed at during his tenure as Congress president), Rohan Gupta, the Congress Party’s social media chairperson, is set to be appointed as the head of a new coordination centre with a similar mandate as Prashant Kishor’s in Uttar Pradesh. The social media, data analytics, research, and communication departments will be answerable to Gupta. This rapid rise is because of his stellar work in managing the war rooms of the Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Rajasthan elections. Considered to be close to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Gupta’s rise signals the hegemonic presence of the Gujarat lobby in the Congress. In the recently-held CWC meeting on April 2, Rohan Gupta was the only non-CWC member who took part.
 
After MP, Rajasthan next?
The coronavirus scare seems to be having little or no impact on the disquiet in the Rajasthan Congress, where chief minister Ashok Gehlot is at loggerheads with his deputy, Sachin Pilot. When prime minister Narendra Modi video-conferenced with CMs, many appeared with their deputies and senior ministers but Pilot was kept out. While Gehlot is trying to take full credit for his handling of the coronavirus crisis in Bhilwara and other places, Pilot is never short of pointing out the shortcomings. The buzz in Jaipur is that a Madhya Pradesh-like political drama is contemplated and a regional party may be floated.
 
BSP leverage in Gwalior-Chambal
There is a sense of anticipation among Bahujan Samaj Party leaders in Madhya Pradesh where byelections to 23 Assembly seats will be held within a few months. The BSP is not a major force in the state but in the Gwalior-Chambal region, where most of the byelections are slated to be held, it has pockets of influence. BSP leaders think both the ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress will go out of their way to accommodate or win the BSP over. It is time for hard bargaining. Is BSP supremo Mayawati keeping tabs?
 
Filmmaker’s overtures
Political circles are intrigued by Pankaj Shankar, an independent filmmaker who is closely identified with the Congress. Of late, however, Shankar has been attacking and abusing Rahul Gandhi with a vengeance on social media platforms. He released a web series mocking and ridiculing the former AICC chief. His fictional account titled Love You Pappu, however, does not even have a fig-leaf to cover his political slant. The teaser giving a glimpse of the work culture in the Congress shows Mahatma Gandhi visiting Pappu’s office and not getting an appointment.
 
Perhaps Shankar is headed for greener pastures. But following the induction of Tom Vadakkan, an AICC media department functionary, the BJP does not seem interested in taking in lowly functionaries whose claim to fame has been “famous for being famous”. Two media-savvy brothers from Pune have also been unsuccessful in selling their loyalty though they adopted different methods.

"Singapore: Singapore was criticised for being “cruel and inhumane” Wednesday after a death sentence was handed down via video-conferencing platform Zoom.
Malaysian drug trafficker Punithan Genasan was Friday sentenced to hang in a hearing conducted remotely due to restrictions in place to combat the spread of the coronavirus, court officials said.
 
The 37-year-old had been found guilty over the trafficking of at least 28.5 grams (1.0 ounce) of heroin, a crime punishable by death under the city-state’s tough anti-drugs laws.
The Supreme Court said that it was the first criminal case where a death sentence was handed down in a remote hearing.
Zoom has become popular during virus lockdowns worldwide for everything from virtual school classes to business meetings—but Human Rights Watch criticised its use to mete out capital punishment.
“The death penalty is inherently cruel and inhumane, and Singapore’s use of remote technology like Zoom to sentence a man to death makes it even more so,” said the group’s deputy Asia director Phil Robertson.
 
“It’s pretty astounding the prosecutors and the court are so callous that they fail to see that a man facing capital punishment should have the right to be present in court to see his accusers,” he told AFP.
The Supreme Court said that the hearing was conducted remotely “for the safety of all involved in the proceedings”.
Singapore maintains that the death penalty—a legacy of British colonial rule—is necessary as a deterrent against crime although rights groups have long called for it to be abolished.

"I was speaking yesterday to a friend from Bangalore who has lived in the United States for most of his life. He is employed by a software firm and his work requires him to travel to India three times a year. I have known him for about a quarter century and he has been coming with regularity. It has been his routine and he spends at least 60 days each year in India on work.
However, he will not be coming to Bangalore next month, as he was supposed to do, and he does not know when he would next be sent. Companies and businesses will not put their employees at risk any time soon, especially those firms based in America and Europe. They have laws which individuals can use if they feel they have been endangered and their safety jeopardised by their employer. Till there is a vaccine for Covid-19, this situation will remain uncertain.
 
Of course, this will have an impact on the airlines. Already there is a ban on international travel pretty much across the world. Europeans cannot go to America and vice versa. No passenger flights are operating in India. Even when the lockdown is opened in mid April, the number of people flying on work internally will be low and after an initial couple of days when those who are stuck go immediately to where they need to be, the traffic will be lower each month than it was last year.
How will airlines, which operate on very thin margins and sometimes operate at a loss as we have seen in India, manage? They will not be able to and the state will need to decide whether to bail them out (meaning tax payer money to be used on airplane leases and pilot and crew salaries) or let them die. From a position where India was about to sell its national carrier, Air India, we are faced with the possibility that the government buys stakes in a few more and possibly all airlines.
 
Tourism employs something like 10 per cent of the world’s population. My friend stays in a hotel in Bangalore and that place will also lose income from business travellers for the foreseeable future. Restaurants will be hit for the new few months as people will continue remaining home unless absolutely required to be in public spaces. Similarly, malls and cinema halls and all those sorts of places which have high levels of mingling and crowds will suffer crushing losses of revenue. How will we cope and what will our new economy look like? We do not know at this point and we will need to learn as we go along.
 
The chief economist of HDFC bank has written this week that the cost of Covid 19 to the Indian economy will be $100 billion, or Rs 7.5 lakh crore. That is equal to what India spends on defence plus all central government schemes (MNREGA, education, health, PM Awas, Smart Cities, Swachch Bharat, Mid Day meals, drinking water, irrigation etc) combined. Meaning that either we do not spend on all these things, which is not possible, or we borrow or print the money required to do all this.
It is hard to imagine a sector which will not be violently affected by the health crisis, the lockdown and what will come after. The sales for cars and automobiles in March were 50 per cent lower in India than they were in March 2019. This is despite the fact that we lost only about eight days due to the lockdown that month. In April the hit will be bigger because half the month is part of the lockdown. Power consumption was 25 per cent lower this week than in April 2019. This is entirely because factories are shut down and will lose three weeks of output at least. After that, they will hope that their workers return from villages and that is not going to happen soon.
 
There are three or four estimates on what the cost to the Gross Domestic Product of India will be. The most positive one says that we will lose two per cent points of GDP growth. The most negative says we will lose four per cent. The truth is that nobody knows at the moment what will come in April and May, just as nobody anticipated in February that March would turn out the way that it did though the Coronavirus story was already in the headlines then.
It will occupy the world for the rest of 2020 and perhaps even beyond that and will have medium and long-term ramifications. The short term ones, the ones that we have described above, are immediate and visible. But there will be others, especially on the future of the global economy, that may impact us for an entire generation. Because we are currently in the middle of the immediate health crisis, there has not been much discussion of this so far but it will start soon.
 
It is a very difficult task ahead for the prime minister and for the nation, even after the lockdown ends.

"On April 1, a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emailed Nevada public health counterparts for lab reports on two travelers who had tested positive for the coronavirus. She asked Nevada to send those records via a secure network or a “password protected encrypted file” to protect the travelers’ privacy.
The Nevada response: Can we just fax them over?
 
You’d hardly know the U.S. invented the internet by the way its public health workers are collecting vital pandemic data. While health-care industry record-keeping is now mostly electronic, cash-strapped state and local health departments still rely heavily on faxes, email and spreadsheets to gather infectious disease data and share it with federal authorities.
This data dysfunction is hamstringing the nation’s coronavirus response by, among other things, slowing the tracing of people potentially exposed to the virus. In response, the Trump administration set up a parallel reporting system run by the Silicon Valley data-wrangling firm Palantir. Duplicating many data requests, it has placed new burdens on front-line workers at hospitals, labs and other health care centers who already report case and testing data to public health agencies.
 
There’s little evidence so far that the Palantir system has measurably improved federal or state response to COVID-19.
Emails exchanged between the CDC and Nevada officials in March and early April, obtained by The Associated Press in a public records request, illustrate the scope of the problem. It sometimes takes multiple days to track down such basic information as patient addresses and phone numbers. One disease detective consults Google to fill a gap. Data vital to case investigations such as patient travel and medical histories is missing.
 
None of this is news to the CDC or other health experts. “We are woefully behind,” the CDC’s No. 2 official, Anne Schuchat, wrote in a September report on public health data technology. She likened the state of U.S. public health technology to “puttering along the data superhighway in our Model T Ford.”
Holes in the data
This information technology gap might seem puzzling given that most hospitals and other health care providers have long since ditched paper files for electronic health records. Inside the industry, they’re easily shared, often automatically.
 
But data collection for infectious-disease reports is another story, particularly in comparison to other industrialized nations. Countries like Germany, Britain and South Korea _ and U.S. states such as New York and Colorado _ are able to populate online dashboards far richer in real-time data and analysis. In Germany, a map populated with public data gathered by an emergency-care doctors’ association even shows hospital bed availability.
In the U.S., many hospitals and doctors are often failing to report detailed clinical data on coronavirus cases, largely because it would have to be manually extracted from electronic records, then sent by fax or email, said Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo.
 
It’s not unusual for public health workers to have to track patients down on social media, use the phone book or scavenge through other public-health databases that may have that information, said Rachelle Boulton, the Utah health department official responsible for epidemiological reporting. Even when hospitals and labs report that information electronically, it’s often incomplete.
Deficiencies in CDC collection have been especially glaring.
In 75% of COVID-19 cases compiled in April, data on the race and ethnicity of victims was missing. A report on children affected by the virus only had symptom data for 9%of laboratory-confirmed cases for which age was known. A study on virus-stricken U.S. health care workers could not tally the number affected because the applicable boxes were only checked on 16% of received case forms. In another study, the CDC only had data on preexisting conditions _ risk factors such as diabetes, heart and respiratory disease _ for 6% of reported cases.
 
Missing from daily indicators that CDC makes public is data such as nationwide hospitalizations over the previous 24 hours and numbers of tests ordered and completed _ information vital to guiding the federal response, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.
“The CDC during this entire pandemic has been two steps behind the disease,” Jha said.
Reinventing the wheel
Instead of accelerating existing efforts to modernize U.S. disease reporting, the White House asked Palantir, whose founder Peter Thiel is a major backer of President Donald Trump, to hastily build out a data collection platform called HHS Protect. It has not gone well.
 
On March 29, Vice President Mike Pence, who chairs the task force, sent a letter asking 4,700 hospitals to collect daily numbers on virus test results, patient loads and hospital bed and intensive care-unit capacity. That information, the letter said, should be compiled into spreadsheets and emailed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would feed it into the $25 million Palantir system.
On April 10, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar added more reporting requirements for hospitals.
Those mandates sparked a backlash among stressed hospitals already reporting data to state and local health departments. Producing additional cumbersome spreadsheets for the federal government “is just not sustainable,” said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.
 
HHS Protect now comprises more than 200 datasets, including reporting from nearly three-quarters of the roughly 8,000 U.S. hospitals, according to Katie McKeogh, an HHS press officer. It includes supply-chain data from industry, test results from labs and state policy actions.
But due to limited government transparency, it’s not clear how accurate or helpful HHS Protect has been. Asked for examples of its usefulness, McKeogh mentioned only one: White House task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx receives a nightly report based on what the system gathers that provides “a common (nationwide) operating picture of cases at a county level.”
 
“We will continue to work to improve upon the common operating picture,” McKeogh said when asked about holes in HHS data collection. Neither HHS nor the CDC would provide officials to answer questions about HHS Protect; Palantir declined to discuss it on the record.
Fixing the problem
Farzad Mostashari, who a decade ago oversaw the federal effort to modernize paper-based medical records, said it would be far more efficient to fix existing public-health data systems than to create a parallel system like HHS Protect.
“We have a lot of the pieces in place,” Mostashari said. A public-private partnership called digitalbridge.us is central to that effort. Pilot projects that automate infectious disease case reporting were expanded in late January. Overall, 252,000 COVID case reports have been generated so far, said CDC spokesman Benjamin N. Haynes. In December, Congress appropriated $50 million for grants to expand the effort, which is already active in Utah, New York, California, Texas and Michigan.
 
Going forward, the CDC is evaluating how to spend $500 million from March’s huge pandemic relief package to upgrade health care information technology.
In the meantime, public-health officers are still doing things the hard way. Up to half the lab reports submitted for public health case investigations lack patient addresses or ZIP codes, according to a May 1 Duke University white paper co-authored by Mostashari.
“We’re losing days trying to go back and collect that information,” said Hamilton of the epidemiologists’ council. “And then we’re reaching out to hospitals or physicians’ offices that, quite frankly, are saying ‘I’m too busy to tell you that.””

"New York: With concerts on hold to halt coronavirus spread, the gaming world is increasingly catering to music lovers, with artists becoming animated performers in virtual realms to the trippy delight of millions.
The trend has gained momentum in recent weeks after the ultra-popular Fortnite morphed rapper Travis Scott into a massive psychedelic spaceman performing in a celestial dreamscape, as a record-setting 12.3 million concurrent players entered his 10-minute set inside the game.
 
According to the platform that’s spurred an international gaming craze since launching in 2017, over 27.7 million unique players participated in the Scott show across its premiere and four encore presentations.
And in early May Fortnite launched an enormous virtual party featuring DJs including deadmau5 and Steve Aoki, celebrating its milestone of 350 million registered players.
The pandemic didn’t prompt transforming artists into avatars—DJ Marshmello had a massive Fortnite concert in 2019 -- but that much of the globe’s population has been urged or forced to stay home over COVID-19 has certainly spotlighted it.
 
Acknowledging the unfortunate circumstances coronavirus has wrought more broadly, Adam Arrigo—the CEO of Wave, an entertainment technology company that has put on concerts from DJ Jean-Michel Jarre and now is teaming with artists including R&B singer John Legend—said virtual show business “has exploded” due to quarantine measures.
“It’s kind of given us a chance to show people really what the value, both creatively and economically, of virtual concerts is,” said Arrigo, who co-founded Wave in 2016.
 
‘Visual spectacle’
Virtual concerts in Fortnite or on other gaming platforms, as well as streaming outlets like YouTube live or Twitch, are a different, much more elaborate animal than the concerts many stars have launched recently on Instagram or Facebook live apps.
A musician himself, Arrigo told AFP the virtual experience intends to take viewers “where I can be any avatar I want, or the performer can take me on a journey—just like I feel when I go to a physical show.”
 “You’re not beholden to the laws of physics or gravity, so you can just do anything,” the 36-year-old said.
 
These types of shows see performers transformed into an avatar that uses computer vision and motion capture technology to mimic the artist’s live movements in real-time—“when they smile, their avatar smiles,” explained Arrigo.
Pandemic rush              
The pandemic is an ideal moment to market: Most game developers “are treating this period the way that they would look at traditionally fruitful market periods,” said Dmitri Williams, a communications and technology scholar at the University of Southern California.
 
Arrigo holds that virtual concerts can offer a way forward to bolster the industry, a “complement” to live performances, once they return, for fans to enjoy and artists to earn income from.
For now, income streams include ways to make the virtual concert experience “VIP”—buying virtual goods for your avatar, or sending a performer onstage flowers in the hopes they’ll interact with you.
Ticketed streams at different price points are also an option to up revenue, said Arrigo.

"With the cult classic film Hera Pheri completing 20 years after its release in March 2000, the buzz about a series revival is stronger than ever before. Starring Paresh Rawal as Baburao with Akshay Kumar and Suniel Shetty as Raju and Shyam, the film got two action heroes into comic roles, doing everything unheroic on screen and yet managing to entertain the audience.
“I cannot fathom the kind of response I still get about the film,” reminisces Suniel Shetty, who confirms that a remake is in the works. “The film is happening for sure. I won’t know when,” he had told us recently.
 
“The first part had both of us, action heroes, doing comedy for the first time. We were shooting for the film in Chennai and we wrapped the film in a single location in a lockdown kind of situation —that is how director Priyadarshan works,” the actor further reveals.
If one recalls, the second part never came close to being as funny as the original as most of the actors in the film tried to get loud and get the plaudits that only Baburao got in the film.
Producer Firoz Nadiadwala — who last made Welcome Back — was last speaking to both Priyadarshan as well as Ahmed Khan to see who could direct the third part. Priyadarshan had directed the first part while Neeraj Vora directed the second part. Neeraj was to direct the third part of the film, but he expired. Earlier in 2015, they had planned the film with a partial change in cast with Dostana duo John Abraham and Abhishek Bachchan stepping in along with Suniel playing Ghanshyam, and Paresh retaining his Baburao slot. However, that did not happen.

"In the fight to halt the coronavirus, several countries have been touted as models to be emulated. Chiefly, South Korea is oft cited, justifiably so. However, no country has met with as much success in holding off and beating back the virus as Taiwan, whose geographical and cultural proximity, literally next door, to China makes the feat all the more remarkable. Contained in this narrative are valuable insights for other countries such as India that are still in the throes of this pandemic.
Situated a mere 130 km off the coast of mainland China, Taiwan has 850,000 to 1 million citizens who live or work in China. Although Beijing and Taipei are adversarial regimes, numerous daily flights link the island to multiple major cities in China. Given such proximity, Taiwan would likely be the most affected by any epidemic with origins in China. In fact, it was the hardest hit when SARS broke out in China in 2003. Taiwan then had the highest mortality rate in the world.
 
That did not happen this time.
Taiwan's Covid-19 numbers have been surprisingly low, for a country that has 2.7 million visitors from the mainland annually and almost 12,000 daily just before the Lunar New Year. As of May 12, Taiwan has 440 total coronavirus cases, of which 372 have already been cured. There have been only 7 deaths. With less than 100 active cases, Taiwan has halted the virus at its doorstep. It managed all this in spite of not being a member of the WHO and while organising a national election on January 11.
How was this possible?
 
Led by Experts
Remarkably, Taiwan’s strategy to combat the novel coronavirus nCoV19 was led by experts and scientists who responded with urgency to the initial outbreak in China. Taiwan’s vice-president, Chen Chien-jen is a Johns Hopkins University trained epidemiologist, public health expert and national hero for his role as health minister during the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Similarly, vice-premier Chen Chi-mai is a physician by training and former lecturer who collaborated with Minister for health and welfare Chen Shih-chung, a doctor and former director of Taipei Medical University. According to Channel News Asia (CNA), at 8 A.M on December 31, the latter was informed of at least seven atypical cases of pneumonia in Wuhan. Within an hour an inter-ministerial meeting was held to determine the measures to be taken to tackle the virus. 
 
This response was as agile as the response in Wuhan itself. Over the next few days, suspected-case reporting and hospital infection control measures were strengthened, a level-1 travel notice to Wuhan was announced, and by January 15 all hospitals and the public were notified about the emerging infectious disease. By January 20, Taiwan activated the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) to coordinate and lead the response to the virus. Daily briefings to the public conducted by health minister Chen Shih-chung, attended by nearly 100,000 people, were also important in keeping the public informed and aware. The health minister currently enjoys an approval rating of 91% in Taiwan and has become the country’s most popular politician, even more than President Tsai ing-wen.
 
Flight Screening and Border Controls
Allowing public health experts to direct the response to Covid-19 meant that Taiwan could make a crucial connection very very early: that air travel was the main pathway of virus transmission. So, Taipei acted quickly to restrict and monitor air travel.
On December 31, the very day China reported the outbreak to the WHO, Taiwan began sending healthcare officials into airplanes to check passengers arriving from Wuhan before they disembarked. Within a couple of days, these measures were expanded to include fever screening and full-scale medical examination of suspected cases. Within 10 days after the flareup of the mysterious new virus in Wuhan on January 21, Taiwan closed its borders to all Wuhan residents, and by 6 Feb extended the restrictions to all arrivals from China, six days before any other country did so. Taiwan also issued a ban on all port calls by international cruise ships on Feb 6, to prevent more cases like the Diamond Princess. To monitor all foreign arrivals into the country, passengers were required to sign and complete a health declaration form. As the virus began to spread outside China to places like Thailand and Singapore, travel advisories were issued to these places by February 11. By early March, all foreign arrivals without a residence permit were banned from entering the country.
 
By strange coincidence or premonition, nearly a fortnight before December 31,
on December 18, 2019, in fact, an awards ceremony was held in Taiwan for airlines with outstanding performance in disease surveillance and aviation safety. At the same event, Taiwan CDC, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced their joint collaboration in implementing the Program for Airlines on Disease Prevention, Preparedness and Response, and Emergency Management, the first of its kind in the world. 
 
Central Command Coordinated Measures
Activated on January 20, the Central Epidemic Command Centre proceeded to implement a total of 124 measures so far, including but not limited to border controls and fever screenings. One of the most significant of these was, contrary to WHO advice, a ban on the export of face masks and a decision to increase the production of protective equipment. The ban came into effect on Jan 24, one month before any other country adopted the same measure. According to the Vice-President, by the end of January, Taiwan stockpiled 44 million surgical masks, 1.95 million N-95 masks and 1,100 negative pressure isolation rooms. A national mask team was set up and 92 additional production lines were installed and the government requisitioned a total of 73 manufacturing companies. The policy increased the average daily production of masks from 1.9 million in January to 16 million masks daily in April. The CECC also instituted a rationing system for masks, according to which every citizen could buy 3 masks per week, then raised to 9 every fortnight, and finally an online ordering system was instituted.
 
Taiwan’s lightning-quick reaction has undoubtedly saved hundreds of lives and prevented thousands more from becoming infected. The island managed this without ever announcing a lockdown and significantly disrupting domestic economic and social life. Taiwan is also able to avoid, to a certain extent, the economic slump that follows a lockdown. Agencies like S&P and other economists have revised Taiwan’s GDP for 2020, but by a smaller margin than any other industrialised country. Schools, offices, restaurants and malls have remained open through the outbreak, limiting the disruption to the economy. Additionally, the island’s approach of involving the public in the fight against Covid-19 has the additional benefit of inculcating awareness in its public, making a transition to the new normal much smoother. With just 65 active cases left, Taiwan has turned its attention to other countries struggling to contain the virus, with the campaign TaiwanCanHelp, which donates masks and other resources.
 
Most of Taiwan’s measures to combat Covid-19 were announced in late January and early February, taking effect almost immediately. The credit for this accrues to experts and scientists holding political office, who lead the fight against Covid-19, calling the shots and responding to developments in China almost instantaneously. The promptness in enacting these measures has been shown by no other country. While some countries like India were busy hosting grand bilateral summits for foreign leaders and others like USA were turning the virus into a political weapon, Taiwan was preparing for the Covid-19 outbreak, which has held the country in good stead in the months following the initial stages of the outbreak.

"India is in lockdown until April 15 and the city of Punjab saw the most drastic effect of air pollution reduction.
The picturesque snow-clad mountain range was visible for the first time in Jalandhar on Friday, over a week since the lockdown was imposed on the midnight of March 24.
 
The Dhauladhar mountain range, part of the Himalayan range in Himachal Pradesh, became visible in Jalandhar after years as pollution dipped across Punjab.
As more and more residents laid eyes on the entire Himalayan range from their rooftops, social media was filled with some delightful images.
Ace Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh took to his twitter to express his joy about the same.
Indeed it was a sight to behold for all the punjab residents and its something to cherish forever.

"Saloni’s twitter account has 98.3k followers and this charming college student’s impersonation of Kangana Ranaut who she wickedly calls Kangana ‘'Runnout’, has earned her 34.7k likes on Twitter. “I hope she likes it too. I have seen Queen multiple times and I believe Kangana is a great actress,” she quickly adds.
It is Kangana, who by default paved the way for Saloni’s foray into comic videos. “I used to mimic her in school and my friends loved it,” she concedes. This youngster straddles dual worlds. She studies economics and political science by day at her university and recedes into her hostel, to make comic videos. “Initially I only did voiceovers but one day a random video I made went viral and my friends suggested that I should show my face. So I bought this wig from Amazon as a part of my get up and everybody loved it. Everyone was making videos. When I joined insta I noticed that Mallika Dua was making videos. I did not know how to channel my thoughts into a video. My brother Shubham, who has appeared in Amazon Prime’s Hostel Days and he’s a Youtuber, guided me.”
 
And that is how the demure housewife with fierce views became an instant hit. And the biggest high for her was, “When Kusha Kapila messaged me after seeing my video. I was on cloud nine that day,” she says.
Nazma Aapi airs her views nonchalantly on everything from panic buying post corona virus to a desi mother-in-law’s views post lockdown. Like actress Sonam, who Saloni recently impersonated and even got an appreciated response back, the young sensation has the ability to laugh at herself. Recounting an older video on Delhi’s air pollution, she laughingly admits, “I look very poor in that video. I stay at a hostel in Delhi. I opened the door, it was so hazy, I just woke up, did not wash my face, used my phone camera and started shooting. I look so pathetic.”
 
You’ve got to hand it to Saloni. She exudes remarkable self confidence when she says, “People ask me why I don’t apply make up? So when I mimicked Sonam I put on the best kurta I had, to do justice to Sonam as she is a fashion icon. But Nazmi aapi does not require a makeover,” asserts the girl who also doubles up as the background guy who comments in her videos. I am the guy in the background, I can imitate Jimmy Shergil too, so decided to do the male voice over.”
Saloni who hails from UP modestly states she is not famous in her hometown but wickedly adds that her relatives are wary of her as she might just mimic them. “My nani refuses to speak in front of me as she is afraid that I will imitate her also,” she laughs.
 
Saloni happily admits that none of her videos have generated any hate mails or comments. “I am very balanced and take care not to offend anyone in my social commentary.”
The future looks bright as Saloni is currently doing collaborative videos and ads and will be venturing into radio soon. Speaking about the process of creating, Saloni says that working on filmi impersonations does not take time but when she dons the garb of Nazma Aapi, it takes her 2.5 hours to work on the script and shoot. “My parents are supportive. They told me to not target anybody and that is something that I am cautious about. My brother too was very supportive.”

"Khammam: He waited 40 days as the lockdown kept getting extended, and when the special trains were announced it seemed like a ray of hope. But his village was nowhere near the train routes decided by the Centre. So 25-year-old Kasa Madakami and other migrant labourers began a 500-km walk from Hyderabad to Pandripani village in Malkangiri district in Odisha. After four days in the scorching heat, his journey ended abruptly in Bhadrachalam where he collapsed and died.
Madakami had been employed as a construction worker in Hyderabad. For him and his companions there was no hope left in the city after all the construction work had stopped. The only thing left to do was to go home to their families in their native villages, where everybody knew their names, where somebody cared for them.
 
It was just four days ago, after 40 days of being unemployed and stranded that they decided to start walking, with no hope of getting any government arranged means of transport. Left to their own means, they did not carry enough water and food with for the journey, Madakam Naresh, Madakami’s co-traveller, said.
Walking an average of 80 km a day, they had covered a distance of 320 km and reached Bhadrachalam in 40-degree Celsius heat on Tuesday.
All of a sudden, Madakami collapsed.
He was immediately taken to a hospital but doctors declared him dead on arrival. It was sunstroke, they said.
 
The long walk without water and food in the punishing heat had claimed its victim. “It is a very sad incident in our lives,” Naresh said.
Shocked by his death, Madakami’s friends asked the police for help to take his body home. They hired a vehicle and travelled to Pandripani village in Odisha.
Finally it was the youngster’s dead body that reached home.

"With the cult classic film Hera Pheri completing 20 years after its release in March 2000, the buzz about a series revival is stronger than ever before. Starring Paresh Rawal as Baburao with Akshay Kumar and Suniel Shetty as Raju and Shyam, the film got two action heroes into comic roles, doing everything unheroic on screen and yet managing to entertain the audience.
“I cannot fathom the kind of response I still get about the film,” reminisces Suniel Shetty, who confirms that a remake is in the works. “The film is happening for sure. I won’t know when,” he had told us recently.
 
“The first part had both of us, action heroes, doing comedy for the first time. We were shooting for the film in Chennai and we wrapped the film in a single location in a lockdown kind of situation —that is how director Priyadarshan works,” the actor further reveals.
If one recalls, the second part never came close to being as funny as the original as most of the actors in the film tried to get loud and get the plaudits that only Baburao got in the film.
Producer Firoz Nadiadwala — who last made Welcome Back — was last speaking to both Priyadarshan as well as Ahmed Khan to see who could direct the third part. Priyadarshan had directed the first part while Neeraj Vora directed the second part. Neeraj was to direct the third part of the film, but he expired.

"Billionaire technology entrepreneur Elon Musk had recently taken to the microblogging site to tweet, “Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.”
Even though the Government of India, recently, prohibited the export of surgical masks and ventilators because of its shortage in hospitals, the uber-rich are panic-buying and hoarding ventilators at home at the cost of Rs 10 lakh. Ventilators are used for patients suffering from coronavirus to keep them alive if they struggle to breathe.
 
But is this a sensible move? Experts including Dr Sundeep Lakhtakia, who is a senior consultant at Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, feel otherwise. “This is sheer stupidity and waste of resources. It’s like buying a fighter jet for whenever we may have a war even when one does not know how to fire a missile, let alone fly a plane,” he says.
To begin with, those buying/hoarding a ventilator tend to forget that they will still need someone to manage the machine at home. Moreover, where will they find the necessary therapist or doctor to run the ventilator if it comes to that? For those wondering if it is, in the first place, possible to run a critical care patient privately at home especially in the Indian scenario, Dr Khizar Raoof, Consultant Urologist, Olive Hospital, shares his thoughts. “Unless they have an intensivist — a specialist doctor handling ICUs  — at home, it’s of no use. We just don’t have enough staff to run hospitals, let alone home ventilators,” he cautions. Adding to the above thought, Dr Sunil Kapoor, senior Interventional Cardiologist, Apollo Hospitals, says, “It needs to be connected to a high-pressure oxygen line, which is available only in the ICCU of hospitals.”
 
Procedure and infrastructure
In addition to the above, ventilator settings also must be monitored and changed as per the patient’s need, depending on the patient’s condition. What’s more, the patient must be appropriately sedated to tolerate the ventilator. So essentially, the issue here is about how to set it up.
“Adjustment of a ventilator is an hourly issue,” explains Dr Chaitanya Challa, Challa Nursing Home. “A doctor has to be constantly present to adjust it. Buying an oxygen concentrator at home is acceptable, but a ventilator at home is not feasible. Ventilators also need an oxygen supply and compressed air, which is again not possible at home.”
 
According to Dr K. Subba Reddy, Sr Consultant Critical Care, Apollo Health City, ventilating a patient requires the entire intensive care infrastructure. “Just buying ventilators and keeping them ready outside ICU settings is not advisable. Sometimes, they may require prolonged ventilator support,” he adds. “Further, they require good doctors and nurses to take care of them. They may also require other organ support such as dialysis and multiple other consultants’ involvement. Added to it all, they will require very close monitoring to wean off the ventilator. So, it is not possible to create efficient ICUs at home.”
 
Other valid concerns
In government-run hospitals, it is very difficult to get vacant ventilators. In private hospitals, ventilators are available but are highly priced. So also, experts think it unwise and warn against anyone getting into an unnecessary panic-buying of ventilators during this time.
“In the Indian scenario, if things go worse, the government will take over all the ventilators. Even the ones in private hospitals,” warns Dr Khizar Raoof. “They’re already getting private medical colleges ready, and if the need arises, private hospitals will also become a part of the war against corona.”
 
Dr Sunil Kapoor also reminds people that very few of the corona patients need ventilators in the first place.
“COVID-19 infection results in respiratory distress syndrome in only 2-4 per cent of people. For instance, as of now, there are 40 patients admitted in the COVID-19 ward of the Gandhi Hospital and not a single patient is on ventilator,” elaborates Dr Sunil Kapoor.

"Mumbai: Big ticket releases such as Amitabh Bachchan’s Gulabo Sitabo may bypass theatres and premiere directly on digital platforms, being seen as a potential saviour for the film industry in a year marred by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty over when cinemas will open.
Faced with the question of going ‘direct to digital’ or waiting for theatres to open after the situation improves, many filmmakers and production houses are exploring the option of heading to streaming platforms, industry insiders said.
 
Shoojit Sircar’s Amitabh-Ayushman Khurrana starrer Gulabo Sitabo, Anu Menon’s eponymous biopic on math genius Shakuntala Devi, with Vidya Balan in the title role, as well as Chehre, another Amitabh film, are among the films likely to be released soon on a streaming platform.
“The deal of releasing ‘Gulabo Sitabo’, a quirky comedy set in Lucknow, and ‘Shakuntala Devi’ on Amazon Prime Video has been locked. The official announcement for both the films is most likely to be made this week,” a source close to the streamer told PTI.
 
Ronnie Lahiri, producer on “Gulabo Sitabo”, neither confirmed nor denied reports when PTI reached out to him but asked journalists to wait for an official statement.
An insider on the team of “Shakuntala Devi” also did not comment about the film’s digital release.
“Chehre” producer Anand Pandit said a digital release was under consideration.
“Given how the lockdown is panning out, a digital release for ‘Chehre’ is being mulled,” Pandit said, adding they would wait till the first week of June to take a final call.
 
The one official announcement was the release of Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s film “Ghoomketu”, which streamed on ZEE5 last week.
Most other plans are shrouded in secrecy with officials reluctant to come on record. But the list of 2020 films that will be released on streaming platforms is long, said insiders.
Top on the list is Laxmmi Bomb, featuring Akshay Kumar and backed by Fox Star Studios, which has reportedly been picked up by the recently launched service Disney+ Hotstar. However, Hotstar representatives maintained a “no comment” stance as did producer Tusshar Kapoor.
 
The movie, directed by Raghava Lawrence, was scheduled to be released on May 22 in theatres. That is unlikely to happen with no signs of cinema theatres opening even if the lockdown ends.
The other 2020 releases—Varun Dhawan-starrer Coolie No 1, Bachchan’s Jhund and Jahnvi Kapoor’s ‘Gunjan Saxena’—are also likely to head to different OTT platforms.
Kiara Advani-starrer Indoo Ki Jawani, co-produced by Nikkhil Advani and Bhushan Kumar, is also reportedly looking for a digital release.
However, Advani said the film is currently being edited “despite physical constraints” and the team is optimistic it will be ready “very soon”.
 
“We are exploring all possible avenues. Nothing stands confirmed or committed. As soon as we are clear about the way ahead, we will make a statement,” he said.
Bhushan’s T-Series’ has two other films, Ludo and Jhund.
While questions sent to Bhushan on the slate of his films were unanswered, a source from the production house confirmed that T-Series is planning to release its films digitally and talks are currently on.
There are also some producers who want to wait it out.
Producer Jackky Bhagnani, who was looking forward to the theatrical release of  Coolie No 1 on May 1, said he is not thinking about films right now.
 
“Let us overcome this crisis and we will announce in happier times,” Bhagnani said when asked about whether he was looking at releasing the film digitally.
Reliance Entertainment said it will wait to release two of this year’s most awaited films — Akshay starrer Sooryavanshi, and ‘83’, fronted by Ranveer Singh.
The team will wait for the lockdown to be lifted and release these movies in theatres.
“We will first complete the film then we will wait. If six or nine months down the line the situation becomes much worse we will take a call at that time. There is no hurry. Same is the case with Sooryavanshi and our other films,” Reliance Entertainment Group CEO Shibashish Sarkar told PTI last month.
 
Irrfan Khan’s last film Angrezi Medium headed to OTT platforms soon after its theatrical release as the lockdown led to cinema halls being closed.
“There is a lot of big money involved. Also, if you release on OTT you cannot release it in theatres. If you release a film in theatre it will come on satellite as well as digital later,” said trade analyst Taran Adarsh.
Last week, the Multiplex Association of India (MAI) appealed to studio partners, producers, artistes and content creators to support the cinema exhibition sector by holding their films and releasing them in theatres once they reopen.
 
The statement followed reports that several films were looking at a direct to digital release amid the lockdown.
The combination of “pent-up demand” and the promise of new movies would boost film business and contribute massively in reviving the industry, the association said.
“The collective, social experience of watching films on the big screen needs to be preserved and it can be done so only with the collective support of all stakeholders,” the statement from the body read.
“One can’t say the film will lose or gain from a digital release, because when you release a good film in theatres, the sky is the limit,” Adarsh added.

"Hyderabad: The relative of a person who died of Covid-19 on Sunday has refuted the Telangana government’s claim in its official daily Covid-19 media bulletin that there were no Covid-related deaths on Sunday. The death was not reported in the bulletin issued on Monday as well.
Aditya Belde, a resident of Ziaguda, said his 51-year-old paternal uncle died of the disease at Gandhi Hospital at around 10 am Sunday. “I want to know why his death has not been reported in the official bulletin which was released much later in the day. I think the officials had enough time to update the information,” he said.
 
Belde took to Twitter on Monday to report the death and sought an explanation from the government on the omission of his uncle’s demise from the health department’s report on the Covid-19 situation on Sunday.
Belde’s uncle had been suffering from a heart ailment for a few years. On Thursday, May 7, his health deteriorated, so the family took him to a private hospital. There, they were asked to get him tested for Covid-19 at a government hospital.
“My relatives took my uncle to Fever Hospital the same day. He was taken inside for just around 10 minutes, after which they said he didn’t have Covid-19 and could be taken home,” he said.
 
The patient’s health continued to deteriorate, and on Friday evening, the family took him to a corporate hospital in Begumpet, where he was treated previously. The doctors at this hospital informed the family that the patient needed to be on a ventilator and that he should be tested for Covid-19.
Accordingly a sample was collected and sent to Gandhi Hospital. “On Saturday night, the test results came back and we found he was Covid-19 positive,” said Belde.
Almost immediately, his uncle was processed for a transfer to Gandhi Hospital. Belde was told to accompany his uncle to do the formalities there. “We reached Gandhi Hospital at around 4:30 am and it took an hour before he was admitted. I wasn’t allowed to be near him but I could observe from a distance,” he said.
 
He returned home after a couple of hours. At around noon on Sunday, he got a call from a policeman who told him his uncle had passed away at 10 am on Sunday. By evening, the cremation had been arranged at a local crematorium, which no family member was able to attend.
Nine members of the deceased man’s family, including Belde, were transported to an isolation facility at the Government Ayurvedic Hospital at Erragadda as they lived together as a joint family.
Their swabs have since been taken for Covid-19 tests. Belde wonders why the government did not add his uncle’s death to the official bulletin. “It is very confusing. We need some clarity on this matter,” he said.
 
The family is also upset that their sick relative was made to run around various hospitals for three days before he was tested positive for Covid-19.
“At Coranti (Fever Hospital) they examined him for just 10 minutes and sent him home. They didn’t even collect his samples. Had he been tested earlier, he could have been saved,” Belde said.
At the corporate hospital the doctors told them about the test result only after they had made payment for the treatment there. “We paid Rs 1.70 lakh for my uncle’s treatment. Just 15 minutes later, we were told he was Covid-19 positive. We are extremely suspicious about this, to say the least,” he said.
 
Belde said that his uncle had no travel history. “Since the lockdown began in March, he left the house only a few times. He only went out to buy vegetables and groceries. He had no travel history,” he said.

Sometimes, they may require prolonged ventilator support,” he adds. “Further, they require good doctors and nurses to take care of them. They may also require other organ support such as dialysis and multiple other consultants’ involvement. Added to it all, they will require very close monitoring to wean off the ventilator. So, it is not possible to create efficient ICUs at home.”
 
Other valid concerns
In government-run hospitals, it is very difficult to get vacant ventilators. In private hospitals, ventilators are available but are highly priced. So also, experts think it unwise and warn against anyone getting into an unnecessary panic-buying of ventilators during this time.
“In the Indian scenario, if things go worse, the government will take over all the ventilators. Even the ones in private hospitals,” warns Dr Khizar Raoof. “They’re already getting private medical colleges ready, and if the need arises, private hospitals will also become a part of the war against corona.”
 
Dr Sunil Kapoor also reminds people that very few of the corona patients need ventilators in the first place.
“COVID-19 infection results in respiratory distress syndrome in only 2-4 per cent of people. For instance, as of now, there are 40 patients admitted in the COVID-19 ward of the Gandhi Hospital and not a single patient is on ventilator,” elaborates Dr Sunil Kapoor.

"A recent post on M.S. Dhoni’s daughter Ziva’s account, which is managed by her parents, a video shows India’s most experienced Indian wicketkeeper and batsman enjoying quality father-daughter moments with Ziva.
In the video, the duo seem to be running a friendly race on their large, well-mowed and primly tended-to lawn at his Ranchi home.
 
And then began the relentless posts of the Captain Cool’s ‘latest looks’ of him with a full-grown salt-and-pepper beard, wearing a green T-shirt with the words “SPECIAL FORCES AIRBORNE” on it, standing
However, former Team Blues captain’s latest grey-bearded look seems to have disappointed many of his fans, sending Twitter into a frenzy. Some seem to have simply seen him as an unshaven, old man! “Aww... M. S Dhoni in Salt And Pepper Look... :-)) ?? (sic),” a CSK fan wrote.
In addition to comments highlighting disappointments were memes that showed “before and after” photos of Captain Cool.
 
One fan, for instance, posted two of Dhoni’s pictures. One was of his when he arrived in Chennai for the practice games of the now-called-off IPL matches sometime last month, seen clean-shaven with a close-crop crew-cut haircut. The second picture was a recent one of him in which he is seen.
One such meme had the caption, “Dhoni before lockdown vs after lockdown. March month he arrived Chennai with a fresh look & we would hve seen him in #Yellove now But corona had other idea & Ruined everything ????.”
Another CSK fan posted his recent pic and wrote against it, “How the men looks after carrying the entire burden and blame for past 10 years..!  This pic is very emotional msdians.. (sic).”
 
Another supposedly shaken fan wrote, “Dhoni looks so old.. (sic).”
Mother knows best
Even as people have been sharing sad emojis and wondering about their favourite cricketer’s cricketing plans (and there are indeed speculations about his retirement), his mother, Devaki, seems far from worried.
Speaking exclusively on the telephone from Ranchi, Devaki tells us, “Yes, I have seen his new look, but he’s not that old. No child is ever old for any mother.”
As for our apprehensions about his quitting the game, she adds, “I am not sure about his playing the TT-20 World Cup. He knows best when to take a call. Let the coronavirus outbreak get over first.”
 
Of course, there were compliments pouring in for the look too. “Vintage white beard look,” one fan wrote with the fire emoji next to it.

"Washington: One week after Sally realised she was pregnant, her home state Texas temporarily banned abortions, deeming them unnecessary elective procedures that were suspended because of the coronavirus crisis.
So, the 34-year-old, whose name has been changed for this story to protect her privacy, took matters into her own hands—something she never would have considered in the past.
 
Having split with her boyfriend, she decided to buy pills on the internet, and perform her own abortion at home.
It’s illegal, and certainly stressful, but more and more women—faced with difficult decisions during a time of national crisis—are going that route.
“It came in a little Manila envelope. And it was just a five-pack of pills. No instructions—nothing,” Sally told AFP from her home in Dallas.
Getting the pills was not easy. The first two sites she consulted were out of stock. After sending $250 to a third site and enduring several long days of waiting, the envelope arrived.
 
By then, it had been 10 weeks since her last period—the absolute limit in the United States for a medical abortion.
“I was so terrified,” she said.
She googled online to figure out how to use the pills for what is called a “self-managed” abortion.
She took the first pill—mifepristone, commonly known in the US as RU-486, which is used to stop the development of the pregnancy.
The four other pills were misoprostol, which triggers the actual abortion. And then Sally took painkillers.
After a night of “really bad” cramps, and bleeding that “shocked” her, everything went as expected. Sally went back to work the following day, “relieved” that the pills worked properly.
 
“I would have rather had medical supervision, for sure,” she says without hesitation.
Beyond the legal ramifications, how does one find websites where the pills are sold? How do you make sure you get them quickly?
Dozens of women like Sally are exchanging advice, tips and notes about their experiences in the abortion forum on the popular social network Reddit.
Soaring sales
A woman’s right to have an abortion is protected by the landmark US Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade.
Even in normal times, that right has come under threat in some conservative-leaning US states. But several states sought to capitalize on the virus crisis to advance their campaigns.
 
There are also natural impediments to getting an abortion in a time of national crisis: the fear of getting infected at a clinic, the inability to leave home to get the procedure, or even financial distress due to sudden unemployment.
To help women buy their own pills online, the Plan C site lists eight online vendors, and ranks them in terms of price and speed of shipment.
The pills sold by those vendors have been tested and declared reliable in 2018.
One online retailer who asked not to be identified told AFP that sales in the US “increased by 150 percent in April compared to March.”
 
Visits to the Plan C website had doubled by late April as compared with a month before.
Plan C co-founder Elisa Wells said that while 900,000 abortions are performed each year in the United States, 40 percent of them medically, at least 10,000 are done “outside of the conventional medical establishment”—either via pills bought online or in Mexico.
What are the risks?
Abortions using mifepristone and misoprostol are safe, experts say. Complications that require medical intervention are rare.
“In the year 2020, in the United States, the real concerns about self-managed abortion aren’t physical but legal,” explains Jill Adams, the executive director of If/When/How, which puts women who want to abort on their own in touch with attorneys.
 
From mid-March through the end of that month, the association’s hotline received twice as many calls as usual.
Five US states—Arizona, Delaware, Idaho, Oklahoma and South Carolina—have laws that specifically ban self-managed abortion.
But women in other states are not really better protected: some local prosecutors use other laws to convict them, such as those forbidding the practice of medicine without a licence.
Some even charge women with child abuse, or drug-related offenses.
In late March, 21 states asked for the lifting of federal restrictions on sending mifepristone through the mail, saying it limits a woman’s use of telemedicine and forces women to “travel unnecessarily” despite stay-at-home orders.
 
To get around some of the US red tape, the websites offering abortion pills are operated from abroad.
Aid Access, which offers the least expensive abortion pills at $90 a dose, is the only one that has a medical supervisor, Dutch physician and activist Rebecca Gomperts.
For the past year, Gomperts has been locked in a battle with the US Food and Drug Administration, which demanded that she stop providing abortion services via telemedicine.
The pandemic has defeated her for the moment: she cannot get the pills she needs from India, which closed all of its airports.
 
Another online provider, which gets its supplies from Russia, told AFP that it expects to be out of stock for several weeks.
The only service that is authorized to send the pills—in 13 US states—is TelAbortion, which has been up and running since 2016, working with about 700 women.
In March and April, the number of women contacting TelAbortion doubled, as compared with the two previous months.

"New Delhi: Under lockdown and far apart, Sushen Dang and Keerti Narang went online to say their marriage vows—and pulled off a spectacular Indian wedding complete with thousands of guests and raucous Bollywood dancing.
In a country famous for lavish weddings that last for days, the young couple are among a growing number modifying their marriage ceremonies under a virus lockdown that has limited public gatherings.
 
Eager to go ahead with the arranged marriage on the auspicious date selected for them by a priest, the pair turned to the internet to tie the knot.
“We never imagined that even our online wedding would be so grand,” Dang, a 26-year-old data analyst who is based in Toronto, told AFP of the April 19 event.
“A hundred guests joined in our celebration on the app. We live-streamed the ceremony on Facebook which was watched by another 16,000 people.”
The nuptials spanned the country.
Dang, decked out in a turban and traditional sherwani kurta, logged on from Mumbai on the coast of the Arabian Sea, while Narang—in her red bridal finery—joined from Bareilly in northern Uttar Pradesh state that borders Nepal.
 
The priest overseeing proceedings chanted hymns as he sat before a ritual fire at his home in Raipur in the central state of Chhattisgarh, with guests logging in from Delhi, Gurgaon and the southern tech hub of Bangalore.
There were minor hiccups—some elderly family members were accidentally unmuted and pets photo-bombed screens.
But the energy levels remained high and the occasion was capped off with a fun Bollywood-style dance performance by their cousins.
The wedding video posted on Facebook has so far garnered nearly 260,000 views, making the newly-weds “feel like celebrities”.
 
Wedding blues 
The spread of the coronavirus and the nationwide lockdown took place as India’s wedding season was in full swing.
In western Rajasthan state alone some 23,000 weddings meant to coincide with the Hindu Akshaya Tritiya festival on April 26 were called off due to the pandemic.
More than 10 million weddings are held annually in the nation of 1.3 billion people, with the marriage industry estimated to be worth some $40-$50 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG.
The sector—like the rest of the economy—is reeling from the impact of the virus, with planners, caterers and decorators among those who have incurred huge losses.
 
“We thought, ‘Why don’t we be the flag-bearers and drive weddings online?’,” said Adhish Zaveri, marketing director at matrimonial website Shaadi.com which facilitated Dang and Narang’s wedding.
“A wedding is probably the most important day of somebody’s life ... and we thought we have to make it as special and close to a real wedding as possible,” he told AFP.
Online nuptials are among a string of weddings in India that have gone ahead amid the lockdown—with some unusual variations.
 
One couple in Uttar Pradesh said “I do” inside a police station after more conventional venues like banquet halls, hotels and temples were all ordered closed during the lockdown.
Home nuptials 
Zaveri said the significantly cheaper online ceremonies could become an option for couples amid the uncertainty about how long the pandemic is going to last.
Couples are charged less than 100,000 rupees ($1,300) for the virtual services, Zaveri said, adding 12 more such weddings were in the pipeline.
To give the online ceremonies a professional touch, make-up artists and sari-draping experts are hired to help the bride, while a folk singer is engaged to serenade the guests.
 
All participants are sent logins and passwords so that strangers can’t gatecrash the event.
Kirti Agrawal—who married her beau Avinash Singh Bagri on April 14 on the balcony of their relative’s flat as friends and family watched on a videoconferencing app—said the digital approach appealed to her.
“Their (groom’s) family had planned a guest list of 8,000 to 10,000,” Agrawal told AFP.
“It isn't that I am not a fan of big, fat weddings. But when I heard about the wedding-from-home idea, I was very happy.”

"London: Bitcoin miners, whose computer processors enable the running of the world’s most popular virtual currency, will soon face an event that takes place every four years and alters the profitability of the hi-tech industry.
So-called halving is when cryptocurrency-mining companies and individuals find out the reduced payment that they will receive in return for their contribution to the system’s smooth operation.
 
Bitcoin was created in 2008 by a person or group writing under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto as a peer-to-peer decentralised electronic cash system.
The virtual unit was once the preserve of internet geeks and hobbyists but it has since exploded in popularity, with mining performed by huge banks of computers.
How does mining work
Bitcoins are traded via a decentralised registry system known as a blockchain.
The system requires massive computer processing power in order to manage and implement transactions.
That power is provided by miners, who do so in the hope they will receive new bitcoins for validating transaction data.
 
The system poses a complex computer puzzle to decide which miner wins the privilege to validate the block and thus receive the reward.
“To understand halving, it is important to remember the role of miners, who are basically responsible for the bitcoin network security,” ThinkMarkets analyst Fawad Razaqzada told AFP.
“Each time a block of bitcoin transaction takes place, they need to be verified by miners. The miner that verifies each block gets a reward for its work with more, newly created, bitcoins.”
What is halving?
 
This occurs every four years and basically involves the halving of the reward from bitcoin mining.
The cryptocurrency’s first “halving” occurred in November 2012, and the second in July 2016. The third is widely expected to take place around next Tuesday.
“Halving will impact profitability of mining bitcoin because work and resources will need to double in order to achieve the same reward as before,” added Razaqzada.
“However, if the value of bitcoin appreciates significantly then this will offset some of the costs.”
 
Commercial mining operations often occupy huge hangers or warehouses, and consume large amounts of electricity to power and cool the computers, which is a considerable cost in addition to equipment.
Why reduce the reward?
The reward was originally set at 50 bitcoins but it was subsequently reduced to 12.5 and will likely reach just 6.25 next week.
The amount has been trimmed over time in order to implement an overall global limit of 21 million bitcoins.
“With the supply of bitcoins mandated to eventually reach the limit of 21 million, the creator(s) of the digital currency had decided that these rewards must decay exponentially, otherwise supply will not be controlled,” added Razaqzada.
 
“So, the network is programmed to cut the reward every 210,000 blocks, or about every four years,” he said, noting that the halving date depended on mining activity.
What is bitcoin worth?
Bitcoin stood late Tuesday at $9,200 (Rs 7,00,000 approx) after a choppy few months linked to coronavirus markets turmoil.
That compares with $7,100 (Rs 5,40,000 approx) at the start of the year, according to Bloomberg data, but it remains far from the record high $19,511 (Rs 14,80,000) hit in December 2017.
“February and March were rough months for bitcoin like other risk assets, but the digital currency has staged the most impressive recovery,” said Razaqzada.
 
“This is partly due to the fact some investors consider bitcoin to be a safe-haven asset, while some have undoubtedly bought speculatively ahead of the so-called ‘halving’ event in anticipation (that) we may see the value of the cryptocurrency appreciate.”

"Washington: A majority of the US H-1B employers, including tech giants like Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft, use the temporary work visa programme to pay the migrant workers well below market wages, a new report has claimed.
The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers from countries like India and China in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.
 
Nearly 500,000 migrant workers are employed in the US in the H-1B status.
""Among the top 30 H-1B employers are major US firms including Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, Google, Apple and Facebook. All of them take advantage of program rules in order to legally pay many of their H-1B workers below the local median wage for the jobs they fill,"" said the report released by the Economic Policy Institute.
Authored by Daniel Costa and Ron Hira, the report titled ""H-1B visas and prevailing wage levels"" says 60 per cent of H-1B positions certified by the US Department of Labor (DOL) are assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation.
 
While the H-1B programme rules allow this, the DOL has the authority to change it, but has not, it said.
While over 53,000 employers used the H-1B programme in 2019, the top 30 H-1B employers accounted for more than one in four of all 389,000 H-1B petitions approved by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2019, it said.
Half of the top 30 H-1B employers use an outsourcing business model to provide staff for third-party clients, rather than employing H-1B workers directly to fill a special need at the company that applies for the visa, the report said.
 
The report alleged that major US-based technology firms that hire H-1B workers directly, rather than contract them out to third-party employers, had significant shares of their certified H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2, the two lowest wage levels in fiscal 2019, both of which are below the local median wage.
""Until now, much of the public discourse and proposals for reforming H-1B have focused on rules that would constrain the practices of these outsourcing companies,"" the report said.
But researches reveal that many firms that employ H-1B workers directly, including some of the biggest names in the technology industry such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Qualcomm, Salesforce and Uber, pay a large share of their H-1B workers at one of the two lowest wage levels, Level 1 or Level 2.
 
In addition, these direct-hire firms also hire many H-1B workers on a contract basis through outsourcing firms, it added.
Microsoft, the seventh-largest H-1B employer in 2019, assigned one-third (35 per cent) of its positions on Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) as Level 1 and two-fifths (42 per cent) as Level 2. In total, Microsoft assigned more than three-quarters (77 per cent) of its H-1B positions as Level 1 or Level 2, a wage level below the local median wage.
Microsoft assigned only 18 per cent of its positions as Level 3 (the median) wage, and a mere three per cent as Level 4, the only above-median wage level.
 
Amazon, which appears twice in the H-1B top 30, as ""Amazon.com Services"" (no. 4 among the biggest H-1B employers) and ""Amazon Web Services"" (no. 27), also assigned the vast majority of its H-1B positions at one of the two lowest wage levels.
According to the report, Amazon.com Services assigned 34 per cent of its H-1B positions as Level 1 and 51 per cent as Level 2, for a total of 86 per cent of all positions certified.
Amazon Web Services assigned 47 per cent of its H-1B workers as Level 1 and 36 per cent as Level 2. Combined, Amazon.com Services and Amazon Web Services had 12,428 positions certified at Level 1 or 2, for a total of 85 per cent certified at a wage level below the median. Only one in eight (1,684) were certified at or above the 50th percentile (Level 3 or Level 4), it said.
 
Apple, eleventh on the list, assigned 558 of its H-1B positions (two per cent) as Level 1 and one-third (32 per cent) as Level 2, for a combined total of 34 per cent at Levels 1 and 2. Apple assigned 32 per cent as Level 3 and 34 per cent as Level 4.
Google, ranked the fifth-largest H-1B employer, had 9,085 H-1B positions certified by the DOL in fiscal 2019. It assigned less than half of one per cent of its certified H-1B jobs as Level 1 and 54 per cent as Level 2. Only 37 per cent of Google's jobs were certified at or above the median wage, the report said.
 
Facebook assigned only one position as Level 1 and 10 per cent of its 6,118 total H-1B positions as Level 2. Twenty-five per cent were certified at Level 3 and 16 per cent at Level 4. Nearly half (49 per cent) of Facebook's H-1B positions were certified at a wage established by an alternative wage survey, making it difficult to assess its H-1B wage distribution, it said.
Uber, the 29th-ranked H-1B employer in 2019, had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by the DOL. Less than one per cent was assigned as Level 1 and just over half (53 per cent) as Level 2. Just over one-third were assigned as Level 3 and 13 per cent as Level 4.
 
While Uber had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by DOL and hired 1,160 H-1B workers in 2019, in the same year, it made headlines by laying off 400 employees.
The report claims that the top 30 H-1B employers are in fact hiring H-1B workers to fill a very large number of routine (Levels 1 and 2) positions that require relatively little experience and ordinary skills.

"Raipur: The Chhattisgarh government has launched a web portal for home delivery of liquor in green zones of the state to avoid crowding at wine shops during the coronavirus-enforced lockdown, an official said on Tuesday. 
The portal has been named after the state-run CSMCL (Chhattisgarh State Marketing Corporation Limited), which controls the sale of liquor in the state, a public relations department official here said.
 
The liquor shops, which were closed since March 23, opened from Monday across the state, except in the COVID-19 containment zones and shopping malls, following the Centres decision to ease some curbs during the lockdown.  But, a large number of people queued up outside liquor outlets in the state capital Raipur and other districts, defying the physical distancing norms.
“The state government has given permission for online sale of liquor so that crowding at wine shops can be discouraged,” the official said.
People can book orders directly through the CSMCL website or its mobile app available on Play Store.  However, the home delivery facility will not be available in Raipur and Korba districts which are not classified as green zones, the official said.
 
The Centre has classified districts as red, orange and green zones based on the COVID-19 risk profiling.
People will have to register their mobile number, Aadhaar number and address to place an order online, which will be confirmed through an OTP (one time password).  A customer can order up to 5,000 ml of liquor at a time for home delivery, the official said, adding that the delivery charge is Rs 120.

"Higher education in the US is expensive and has led to crippling financial debt for a lot of youngsters—so much so that one of the main campaign promises of the erstwhile presidential election candidate Bernie Sanders was to waive student loans. So, when students who've paid a bomb for the famed campus experience at premier universities were sent home to learn online during the coronavirus pandemic, they didn't feel they got their money's worth.
Now, students at more than 25 US universities are filing lawsuits against their schools demanding partial refunds on tuition and campus fees, saying they’re not getting the calibre of education they were promised.
 
The suits say students should pay lower rates for the portion of the term that was offered online, arguing that the quality of instruction is far below the classroom experience.
Colleges, though, reject the idea that refunds are in order. Students are learning from the same professors who teach on campus, officials have said, and they’re still earning credits toward their degrees. 
Grainger Rickenbaker, 21, who filed a class-action lawsuit against Drexel University in Philadelphia, said there's little interaction with students or professors and some classes are being taught almost entirely through recorded videos, with no live lecture or discussion.
 
Other students report similar experiences elsewhere. A complaint against the University of California, Berkeley, says some professors are simply uploading assignments, with no video instruction at all. A case against Vanderbilt University says class discussion has been stymied and the “quality and academic rigor of courses has significantly decreased.”
In a case against Purdue University, a senior engineering student said the closure has prevented him from finishing his senior project, building an airplane. “No online course can simulate the applicable, real-world experience” he hoped to gain from the project, the complaint says.
 
Class-action lawsuits demanding tuition refunds have been filed against at least 26 colleges, targeting prestigious private universities, including Brown, Columbia and Cornell, along with big public schools, including Michigan State, Purdue and the University of Colorado, Boulder.
Some of the suits draw attention to schools’ large financial reserves, saying colleges are unfairly withholding refunds even while they rest on endowments that often surpass USD 1 billion.
Several colleges declined to comment on the lawsuits, but some said students have continued to get what they paid for.
 
Ken McConnellogue, a spokesman for the University of Colorado, said it’s disappointing that people have been so quick to file lawsuits only weeks into the pandemic. He said the suits appear to be driven by a small number of “opportunistic” law firms.
Lawyers representing students, however, say the refunds are a matter of fairness.
“You cannot keep money for services and access if you aren’t actually providing it,” said Roy Willey, a lawyer for the Anastopoulo Law Firm in South Carolina, which is representing students in more than a dozen cases. “If we’re truly going to be all in this together, the universities have to tighten their belts and refund the money back to students and families who really need it.”
 
Willey said his office has received hundreds of inquiries from students looking to file suits, and his firm is looking into dozens of possible cases. Other firms taking on similar cases say they’re also seeing a wave of demand from students and parents who say they deserve refunds.
Along with tuition, the cases also seek refunds for fees that students paid to access gyms, libraries, labs and other buildings that are now closed. All told, the complaints seek refunds that could add up to several thousand dollars per student at some schools.
 
Scores of schools have returned portions of housing and dining fees, but few if any have agreed to return any share of tuition.
At the University of Chicago, hundreds of students signed a letter saying they will refuse to pay this term’s tuition, which was due April 29, unless the school reduces tuition by 50% and keeps it at that level during the crisis.
The lawsuits ask courts to answer a thorny question that has come to the fore as universities shift classes online: whether there’s a difference in value between online instruction and the traditional classroom.
 
Willey adds that colleges themselves often charge lower rates for online classes, which he says is a reflection of their value.

"Rio De Janeiro: Rarely have two words ignited such a firestorm of controversy.
""So what?"" said Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday when a journalist asked him about the fact that more than 5,000 Brazilians had died of the coronavirus.
 
The far-right leader's off-the-cuff comment has been sparking anger ever since, with governors, politicians, healthcare professionals and media figures all weighing in to express their outrage at his lack of empathy.
Bolsonaro is no stranger to controversy. But his latest remark sparked such a fury because Brazil is facing a seemingly uncontrollable outbreak of the disease and is still several weeks away from the peak of the pandemic, with a death toll that threatens to surpass even the most dire predictions.
There have been more than 91,000 officially confirmed cases so far but scientists warn the real figure could be 15 to 20 times higher.
 
With a death toll that has already topped 6,300, the giant South American country is facing as grim a scenario as Italy or the United States.
""So what? I'm sorry. What do you want me to do?"" Bolsonaro said Tuesday when questioned about his country passing the 5,000-death mark, more than China. He joked that even though his middle name is Messias, or Messiah, ""I don't do miracles.""
Wilson Witzel, the governor of Rio de Janeiro state, called the president's remarks ""absolutely unacceptable.""
With his own state on the verge of a public health meltdown, Witzel slammed the president for ""being ironic about the deaths"" rather than ""being a leader at such a moment.""
 
""Do your job,"" he said on Twitter Wednesday, the day when the pro-gun president was training at a target range, far from the woes of Brazil's 210 million citizens.
'Brasilia bubble'
Joao Doria, governor of Sao Paulo state which is also on the frontlines of the battle against the coronavirus with more than 2,500 deaths already, replied furiously to Bolsonaro in the capital Brasilia.
""Get out of your Brasilia bubble,"" he retorted, urging Bolsonaro to visit hospitals ""in this country which is crying for its dead and infected.""
 
Unlike many other heads of state, the Brazilian leader has not been seen in any hospitals nor has he expressed much solidarity with victims of the disease, bereaved families or healthcare staff who have condemned the lack of ventilators or beds.
The head of the doctors' union in Sao Paulo, Eder Gatti, called on television for ""a more serious attitude from the president of the republic.""
Bolsonaro ""shows very little sensitivity to the tragedies that the families of those directly affected by the pandemic are going through,"" said Lucio Renno, director of the Institute of Political Science at Brasilia University.
 
""His style is the iron fist, to be hard rather than to show solidarity or empathy,"" he told AFP.
It is a style that inevitably draws comparison with Bolsonaro's own role model, US President Donald Trump.
That type of reaction is ""shocking for a large part of the population"" and ""reinforces the idea for a good part of the elites and for the Brazilian people that he is not fit to govern,"" Renno said.
Miriam Leitao, an op-ed writer at the daily O Globo, wrote on Thursday that with his ""So what?"" Bolsonaro had ""renounced the presidency.""
 
""Anyone who shows such contempt for his own people can no longer be president,"" she wrote.
'Judged by history'
In a tactic he has honed since becoming president, Bolsonaro quickly went on the offensive in the face of criticism from the governors and mayors, whom the Supreme Court has granted the power to call the shots in the fight against the pandemic.
""Ask Joao Doria or (Bruno) Covas [the mayor of Sao Paulo] why people continue to die even when they have taken such restrictive measures,"" said the president.
 
""They are the ones who should have the answers, you can't pin that on me.""
Nevertheless the press on Friday blamed the spike in infections and death on Bolsonaro, who has encouraged people to go out to work to prevent an economic crash and whose most fervent supporters have taken to the streets to protest against lockdown orders.
Bolsonaro's ""So what?"" has ""underscored how little importance he has attached to the situation,"" said political analyst Andre Pereira Cesar.
""If the president does not assume a wartime leadership stance against the virus he will be judged harshly -- by history and by voters,"" he warned.

"Friends and foes
BJP leader Subramanian Swamy and TV news anchor Arnab Goswami have little in common but they have had a blow-cold-blow-hot relationship with Sonia Gandhi. In 1998-99, when Sonia formally entered politics and Goswami was a beat reporter with a prominent TV news channel, he was often spotted at 24, Akbar Road, or outside 10, Janpath. On one occasion, Sonia stopped abruptly to give Goswami a soundbite, a first for any news channel. For months Goswami gushed and seldom missed an opportunity to say “hi” to madam. In 2014, he managed a long interview with Rahul Gandhi, which subsequently damaged Rahul’s reputation as a serious politician. Congress sources insist the interview materialised, courtesy Priyanka Gandhi who offered Goswami “chai-pakoda” during the rainy season at her New Delhi residence. Goswami’s recent diatribe against Sonia, therefore, surprised and shocked 10, Janpath.
 
Subramnian Swamy has been both friend and foe to both Sonia and Goswami. Swamy teamed up with Sonia and Jayalalithaa to bring down the Atal Behari Vajpayee regime and caused irreparable damage to his rapport with both ladies. Incidentally, along with Raj Thackeray, Swamy holds the distinction of taming Goswami on air. When Republic TV was launched, Swamy wrote to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting taking exception to the usage 'Republic' for a commercial venture by Arnab. Swamy said that under the Emblems and Names Act, 1950, certain names and emblems such as 'Republic' are prohibited from use for professional and commercial purposes.
 
Manmohan dazed?
Sonia Gandhi has set up a consultative panel to respond to Narendra Modi government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. However, Dr Manmohan Singh, who confers with Rahul Gandhi, P. Chidambaram, Jairam Ramesh and other members of the panel, is finding the video-conference meetings problematic. Often, he misses out on what others are saying. Panel members say the former prime minister looks dazed. But wife Gursharan Kaur insists Manmohan looks forward to the meeting every day.
Shivraj’s dubious choices
The recent Cabinet expansion conducted by Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan disappointed many. About a dozen BJP hopefuls had reportedly parked themselves in Bhopal even though the state capital was a coronavirus hotspot. There were reports that the state garage requisitioned 12 cars but the move was shelved and only five ministers made it. Three former state health ministers, Narottam Mishra, Tulsi Silawat and Kamal Patel (he was minister in charge of medical education), made it without anyone asking why the MP health infrastructure was so weak. The three BJP ministers are not considered personally loyal to Chouhan while the two Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalists are non-MLAs. Given the uncertainly over the coronavirus, many wonder how Chouhan would ensure Assembly by-polls within six months. MP does not have a second house or legislative council.
 
Mishra has in the past been accused of “paid news” during the 2008 Assembly polls. The Election Commission unanimously asked for Mishra’s disqualification but the Delhi high Court set aside the disqualification.
Varun’s dream
For the discerning viewer, Varun Gandhi’s Twitter timeline showering fulsome praise on prime minister Narendra Modi’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is not without significance. Varun tries to draw Modi’s attention at a time when the buzz is that Jyotiraditya Scindia is set to join the Union cabinet. A Gandhi surname and a series of uninterrupted electoral successes have not bolstered Varun’s chances in the Modi government even though his mother is no longer a minister. Is the PM paying attention to Varun’s subtext? Doesn't appear so.
 
Caste in stone
A religious figure is supposed to renounce worldly considerations like caste, sub-caste, etc. But supporters of a CM of a northern state are reportedly working on a strategy to regroup former bureaucrats, academicians, intellectuals, media and others on a caste-based platform. The idea is not new: Chandrashekhar, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, Digvijaya Singh and Rajnath Singh's camp followers tried a similar tactic without success.
Trouble for Shashi Tharoor
MP Shashi Tharoor found himself in a bit of a spot after he announced with fanfare an online meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on information technology. Apparently, Tharoor, a former Union minister of state and a UN official, hurriedly made the announcement after a cursory conversation with Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla. The Lok Sabha secretariat communicated to the speaker that rules to switch over to online meetings have not been approved. The speaker’s office then informed Tharoor that having a meeting of parliamentary panels via video-conferencing will violate the confidentiality clause. A volte-face followed.

"Chennai: “I have had no income since the lockdown began and I have no money left. I have absolutely no idea as to how I will survive this,” said Neelavathi.
As coronavirus victim tales go, this narrative is not entirely a unique one. Neelavathi’s trade, like most other trades, has been dealt a mortal blow, rendering her penniless.
 
But unlike other daily wage earners, who have social support systems, Neelavathi has no one to tell her story to. She’s a commercial sex worker (CSW). Though the problems she mentions are similar to anybody else’s -- no transport, long queues at shops and police chasing her away in the street -- her lack of work is unique. Not only can she not work from home, there’s no place where her clients can reach her.
On a normal day, Neelavathi steps out for work around 10 am and is back home by around 5 pm. She is one of the CSWs engaged to a ‘house’ in Moolakadi, where she is paid Rs 300 for every client she services. At times she may go out with a client to a lodge or a guest house and make Rs 1000 or more. But that happens rarely.
 
Whatever it is, on an average she used to make Rs 500 per day, which was just enough to feed her two children and her. Since she commutes by bus and autorickshaw, the lockdown has left her immobile, confined to her house.
Besides, she has another worry: She has run out of condoms. As a member of the Red Hills Thai Vizhuthugal Nala Sangam, a community-based organisation (CBO) of CSWs, she’s acutely aware of the need for condoms and regularly visits Red Hills to collect her quota of prophylactics.
The president of Red Hills Thai, Poongodi, said the lockdown came out of the blue. After the coronavirus scare began, at an annual meeting of the collective recently, they had discussed the precautions to be taken against the virus. But the lockdown caught them unawares.
 
The CBO has about 1300 members, all of them CSWs. Many of the women often turn to Poongodi for help but this time the CBO is not equipped to give them any.
The president of the Namakkal District Thai Vizhuthugal Women’s Trust, Geetanjali, put out a message on her Facebook page on April 4 seeking help for the members of her trust, many of whom were going without food.
She said among her members were women who lived below the poverty line and those afflicted by HIV.
She told Deccan Chronicle that many of her members were having just a single meal a day and had no money for other basic needs. Some of the women were living alone with no family support and their plight was the worst, she said.
 
The Nammakkal-based CBO has about 1,500 members, living in villages around the town. Geethanjali fears that the coronavirus crisis might lead to a spread of HIV.
How so? She explained that CSWs pushed to the brink are at risk of giving in to sexual demands in lieu of minor financial or material favours in this time of distress and may thus indulge in risky behaviour due to the lackc of a prophylactic.
Agreeing with her, A J Hariharan of the Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO) said CSWs were primarily responsible for containing the spread of HIV in the country in the past. Hariharan, who has been into AIDS/HIV prevention work since the early 1990s, said it was due to the insistence of these women on use of condoms that stopped the HIV infection.
 
Hariharan said there are 6,300 CSWs in Chennai alone and about 90,000 in the whole of Tamil Nadu. All of them have been hit by the lockdown. Even before the coronavirus, many of them lived in abject poverty. Now the loss of livelihood has affected them so badly they cry on the phone while asking for help.
“We have a stomach to feed,” says Latha, who has never faced a situation like this in her six-year career as a CSW.  She has two children to take care of. Normally she would earn about Rs 1000 a day, serving an average of three clients. She used to work from 11 am to 5.30 pm at a ‘house’ near Moolakadi.
 
Latha has not stepped out of street in Vyasarapadi since the lockdown began. But she has found an alternative career to make money from her house. She has started making tea and selling it on the street. She makes about Rs 100 a day. “Something is better than nothing,” she says.

"Ever since Doordarshan announced the re-telecast of some of their iconic TV shows, the actors and producers of the said shows have been at loggerheads.
The decision to air 11 popular shows from the 80s and 90s was taken amidst the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 .
 
The national broadcaster has recorded an all-time high audience as the channel ever since has registered a 650 per cent growth in its viewership.
According to BARC India, the first four shows of Ramanand Sagar’s 'Ramayana' garnered 170 million impressions and DD National became the most-watched channel across the country.
This was followed by the re-runs of classics such as 'Byomkesh Bakshi', 'Shaktimaan', 'Buniyaad', 'Circus', 'Dekh Bhai Dekh', 'Alif Laila', 'Chanakya', 'Upanishad Ganga' and 'The Jungle Book', which became equally popular in the first week and even attracted several sponsors.
 
Due for their diligence
This rekindled popularity has once again drawn the attention to many seasoned yet forgotten actors who had become household names when their shows aired for the first time.
So it’s hardly surprising that some of them are now demanding a royalty from the profits of this re-telecast. 'Byomkesh Bakshi' actor 'Sunil Sinha', in a Facebook post, wrote that the channel and producer should give royalty money to the actors.
“When the government has decided to re-telecast the show, the channel and producer will make money. So when the producer is getting extra money, why not the actors and technicians who have worked hard on the show?” the actor asks.
 
Similarly, Dipika Chikhlia, who played Sita in the epic 'Ramayana' opposite Arun Govil’s Ram, feels that the cast of the show should be respected for their contributions.
“Money doesn’t harm anybody and I would have liked to see the profits shared with the actors as well,” says the actress. She also adds that the actors of the iconic mythological show weren’t duly paid well even when the show was shot.
“Everyone knows when the Ramayana was made, we were paid peanuts. It would have been really nice if we were shown some kind of appreciation with the makers sharing the profits with us,” she says.
 
Trickle down theory
Veteran actress Pallavi Joshi, who played an integral part in the popular 80s show 'Buniyaad', says that India should have adapted the concept of extending royalty to actors, a practice common in the US.
“Actors are actually forced to do a lot of work that they don’t wish to because of not having royalties in place, so it should have been introduced long back,” says the actress.
Mita Vashisht, who shared the screen with Shah Rukh Khan and Ashutosh Gowarikar in the iconic show 'Circus', adds that the industry is not mature enough to acknowledge the efforts of all involved.
 
“It is the actors who have made these shows popular. In a healthy industry, some percentage of royalty should be given to everyone. But our industry is not thoughtful in terms of royalties,” says the 'Dil Se' actress, who feels that everyone needs to respect the actors and technicians’ contributions.
Producers differ
But the producers of these iconic shows, have a parallel view on the matter. For instance, 'Shaktimaan' actor Mukesh Khanna, who is also the producer of the show, clarifies that actors sign a contract agreeing that they will not claim any money or royalty upon the re-telecast of the show, which means that they have no legal claim.
 
“It is not done. Certain things are contractual and actors have to abide by it. The producer can recover the money by all means. As an actor, I would say it sounds good. But as a producer, I will be making money from everywhere,” says the actor who is also a part of the on-going epic show 'Mahabharata' on DD.
“Besides, most of them are seasoned actors and they are doing pretty well in the industry, so why to give them royalty?” he says, refuting the claims made by actors seeking a share of the pie.
Joshi however disagrees with Khanna and feels the claims made by the actors are valid. “The channel hasn’t produced any show, and the effort made by the producer during a re-run is zero. So when the producer is getting the extra money then he should distribute a percentage of it to the actors and technicians who are at home in these difficult times and struggling to put food on the table for their children,” she says.

"Hyderabad: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has notified the state government to extend the lockdown in the state capital till the end of May.
Covid-19 cases have been increasing at alarming pace in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits. Another 30 cases were reported on Friday. Mayor Bonthu Rammohan puts the blame on the people and said if they do not cooperate with the government and observe the lockdown strictly, it would be extended until the coronavirus cases reach zero.
 
Rammohan said chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao has taken a very serious view of people violating the lockdown protocol and may come up with stringent rules after the Cabinet meeting scheduled on April 19. He noted that though about 45,000 vehicles have been seized for violating lockdown rules, people were still moving about on the roads using fake passes.
""We have been keeping strict vigil only in the containment zones by trusting the others. The government is clueless about the number of coronavirus positive cases in the remaining areas. If the public movement is not curtailed and if they do not cooperate with the government, they are risking their lives and those of others,” he said.
 
He cited other cases, one of an onion seller in Rajendernagar who came in contact with a Nizamuddin Markaz returnee and interacted with 45 others and later tested positive and that of a migrant who travelled in a train with Markaz returnees and was asymptomatic but one of his contacts, his landlady, died.
“We are not sure whether a 14-day quarantine is enough to contain Covid-19. I advise people to quarantine for 28 days even though they have tested negative,"" Rammohan said.
He said May would be favourable to contain Covid-19 and the arrival of the monsoon in June could complicate the situation as other contagious diseases spread with the rains.
 
""It is not easy to manage a city with a huge population. The public should abide by the law to contain the deadly virus,"" he said.
He urged residents to click pictures of those who violate social distancing norms at supermarkets, meat shops and other markets and post them on social media platforms. The corporation would seal all the shops for the lockdown period, he said.

"Bengaluru: In this summer of the coronavirus, who doesn’t have a tale of woe? For farmers it’s all-too familiar a situation: just when the crop is coming to hand, a natural disaster strikes and they are unable to reach the market in time and the produce rots in the field.
For horticulturists, this has been such a time: there’s a severe shortage of summer fruits and vegetables in the cities, but they are unable to market their produce.
 
Amidst this gloom, grape farmers in and around Bengaluru have got together to pull off a miracle. Unobtrusively and unknown to many, hundreds of grape growers have coalesced into a direct marketing movement in and around the city.
By skirting market structures and lockdown barriers, they are reaching resident welfare associations direct and selling their produce straight to the consumer.
This movement was initiated by the University of Agriculture Sciences (UAS) Alumni Association to help grape farmers find a market in this corona-hit summer.
 
Look at the difference this is making: while the government-run procurement agency HOPCOMS picks up an average of 2-3 tons of grapes per day from farmers, the direct marketing initiative is moving 250-300 tons a day.
UAS Alumni Association president Dr K Narayangowda says he never dreamed of such a huge response from the people. 
How it began
Around the time when the coronavirus lockdown was declared, vineyards around Bengaluru were approaching harvest. The country was already in the grip of the coronavirus, and a total shutdown of markets spelt disaster for grape growers.
 
Bengaluru’s vines are not linked to the food processing industry; they sell most of their produce to the consumer. If they are shut out now, the crop would have to be destroyed.
Export to other states was out of the question, not with the transport system down and a lockdown everywhere else too. “We had to find a market right here,” said Narayanagowda.
So 12 days ago, the UAS Alumni Association knit up the farmers into a patchwork collective linked with WhatsApp, and made pitches to a few residents’ association.
 
“To understand the market, we went to the HOPCOMS main centre near Lalbagh. We found HOPCOMS procuring grapes for Rs 45 per kg from the farmer and selling it through its outlet just adjacent to the procurement centre for Rs 115 per kg. We were shocked by the margin it was making,'' Narayanagowda said.
Then they visited farmers in the Kolar and Chikkaballapur region and started working out the cost. Farmers were educated on how to pack them and what time they had to harvest once the order was confirmed and delivery schedules.
 
 “We realised that Rs 55 per kg was an ideal price for farmers and we started reaching out to residents' associations by publicising our WhatsApp number. We landed a first order for 1.5 tons,” says Narayanagowda.
It was a good deal for the consumers: where they had to go to the market and buy grapes at Rs 120 per kg, they were getting the same stuff at their doorstep for no more than Rs 55-60 per kg.
In the next three days, the number of orders just baffled them. “We have a lot of residents' association working with farmers. At Rajarajeshwari Nagar, the Rotary Club president has taken the lead and four sets of farmers are supplying them grapes. At the end of the week, we ended up selling over 250-300 tons per day in Bengaluru alone. Besides learning about the market, many farmers are also directly exploring some of the markets,'' he said.
 
“We learnt a lot of things about grape marketing. In the first place, Bengaluru people were never exposed to quality grapes by traders. Very few had access to quality grapes. Some had given up eating grapes. Now, everyday new grape fans are being added to the list. We are making a database and we’ll launch online marketing by next year,'' says Narayanagowda.
What about mango?
The cooperative is planning to try the grape tactics with mango, which is just beginning to come into the market. The mango market is in a similar situation as grape: it cannot be shipped out of the state.
 
However, the grape tactics did not work with other fruits and vegetables. Tomato is harvested at the same time as grapes but its market is different. Over 80 per cent of tomato grown around Bengaluru goes to the Kissan factory for making sauce. But the since the factory is closed, there was no way farmers could find an alternative market. Traders refused to pick up the excess tomato because prices would crash. So farmers had no choice but to let the produdce rot on the farm.
Though vegetable demand and supply remains the same, the situation is exploited by traders. Citing social distance, they have created distance between product and consumer, driving the prices up. But farmers get no dividend from this.

"New Delhi: The Government's mobile app Aarogya Setu, developed for tracking coronavirus patients, has become the world's fastest app to reach 5 crore downloads in just 13 days, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on April 14 appealed to people to download the app.
 
""Telephone took 75 years to reach 50 million users, radio 38 yrs, television 13 yrs, Internet 4 yrs, Facebook 19 months, Pokemon Go 19 days. AarogyaSetu, India's app to fight COVID-19 has reached 50 mn users in just 13 days-fastest ever globally for an App,"" Kant said in his tweet.
The Aarogya Setu app alerts people if any person in their vicinity has tested positive for COVID-19.
District administrations have been asking all educational institutions and government departments to push people to download the app. The more people install the app on their phones, the more effective it becomes at identifying through location data and Bluetooth data, which phones have come into close contact with an infected person.
 
The app accesses data of infected persons from the Ministry of Health and alerts people if they have come into contact with a Covid-19 infected person.
According to sources, Tata Consultancy Services is working on testing the app and some of its other aspects while Tech Mahindra and the Mahindra group is working on the next version of this application leveraging data science and next generation technologies such as machine learning.
Tech Mahindra is also working on expanding the reach of Aarogya Setu to all types of phones. The current version of Aarogya Setu app is fit for use on smartphones only.

"New Delhi: The Indian Army has asked its personnel to use the Covid-19 contact-tracing app Aarogya Setu with caution while following all cyber security precautions.
While urging download of the Aarogya Setu app, it advised personnel to avoid it in office premises, operational areas and sensitive locations. Personnel, veterans and families have been asked to cyber security precautions.
 
Aarogya Setu is a mobile app developed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to help citizens identify their risk of contracting Covid-19.
“Existing cyber security policies on usage of mobile phones must be adhered to by army personnel while using the Aarogya Setu app,” the soldiers were informed, said sources.
The Indian Army has asked its personnel to only switch on the location services and bluetooth features of the Aarogya Setu app while visiting public places, or when they are engaged in managing isolation centres, while on call for COVID-19 related assistance to civil authorities and while out of cantonments or military stations for essential administrative duties.
 
They have been told not to disclose their service identity including rank and appointment. The contact list of the user should not contain any reference to rank appointment or service. Army personnel have been advised to keep their mobile operating systems updated and to install antivirus protection on their cell phones.
The Aarogya Setu app has crossed the 5 crore downloads in just the 13 days since it was launched.
The app uses bluetooth, GPS, algorithms and artificial intelligence to notify users of their risk of catching the COVID-19 infection, by tracing the same data from other users of the app. 
 
The app detects other devices with Aarogya Setu installed that come in the proximity of that phone. GPS tracks the location of the user in real time and bluetooth tracks if and when the user comes in close proximity with someone infected by COVID-19. 
If a user comes into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, they will be notified about it in a few days. The app has access to the Government of India’s database of known cases.

"Kochi: A 71 year old coronavirus infected man from Mahe died on Saturday morning taking the total number of Covid-19 deaths in Kerala to three. P Mehroof, hailing from Cherukallayi in Mahe under Union Territory of Puducherry was undergoing treatment at government medical college hospital, Kannur.
He had other serious medical complications like kidney disease, hypertension and cardiac issues.
 
He was initially admitted in a private hospital and later shifted to the government medical college after being diagnosed with coronavirus infection.
Mehroof has no foreign travel history and it is not clear from where he got the virus infection.
He is reported to have travelled extensively in few panchayats in Mahe area and attended religious ceremonies and marriage functions during the period of March 15 to 21.
The Covid mortality rate is low in Kerala when compared to other parts of the country and the world. Only two deaths were reported during the period from January 30, when the first case was reported, to April 10.
 
In the other two deaths, reported from Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram , the patients had other serious medical complications like cardiac disease and hypertension.
On Friday, seven new Covid cases were reported from the state while 27 patients have been recovered and discharged from hospitals. The total number of confirmed cases is 364 of whom 124 have been recovered.

"Chennai: WhatsApp on Tuesday put spokes in the ever-turning wheel of misinformation by restricting forwards to just one chat at a time. The update has come to India first, in an indication of how widely the platform is being used to spread unverified information in the country. It will soon be rolled out globally.
Similarly in August 2018, WhatsApp limited forwarding to five chats after the platform found it was being used extensively in India to spread misinformation, fake news and propaganda.
 
The app, which has 2 billion users worldwide introduced the curbs globally around January 2019. NDTV reported that WhatsApp claimed the restrictions led to a 25 per cent decrease in forwards globally.
The report also cited consulting firm Kantar as having found a 40 per cent increase in WhatsApp usage as COVID-19 began spreading globally. The messaging app owned by Facebook was reported to have made the “greatest gains” in usage among social media apps.
Now, with fake news threatening to derail efforts to combat the deadly coronavirus pandemic, WhatsApp, which has 400 million users in India, has introduced the stricter curbs in the country.
 
However, one can still use the forward option several times to send a message to multiple users or copy a message and paste it to various chats.
To ensure that users got only authoritative information on COVID-19, WhatsApp had recently collaborated with the Government of India to create a chat bot to answer queries.
Earlier, in August, WhatsApp added a ‘Forwarded’ label to messages that were not composed by a close contact of the user.
Last month, the app also took measures to mark certain forward messages as requiring verification, on its beta version. A magnifying lens icon appearing alongside the message prompted users to search online and verify the content. But since the update has not been rolled out for all users, several messages and videos were still being shared without being flagged in any manner.

"Saad’s dubious hand
The Tablighi Jamaat’s (TJ) reckless and irresponsible conduct in the current coronavirus outbreak has surprised many within the Muslim community. The Tablighis have largely been an apolitical and disciplined lot with a penchant for holding large conclaves where after-life matters are deliberated and discussed. However, of late, TJ has been witnessing an intense power struggle between its chief Maulana Saad Kandhlawi and a powerful lobby consisting of the ‘shoura’ (executive council).
 
Saad, a great-grandson of TJ founder Maulana Illyas, reportedly wanted to be one-up on his rivals and ignored saner voices to defer the Delhi-Nizamuddin congregation. Instead, his supporters ensured crowd mobilisation from southern states like Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Kerala, with disastrous consequences. Maulana Saad's role in the TJ headquarters sharing a wall with the Nizamuddin police station has been as dubious. The police reportedly were regular beneficiaries of food and other goodies coming from the TJ office which blurred their vision to act swiftly and decisively.
 
The rise of Rohan Gupta
After successfully convincing the grand old party to begin working through video-conferencing (something that Rahul Gandhi tried and failed at during his tenure as Congress president), Rohan Gupta, the Congress Party’s social media chairperson, is set to be appointed as the head of a new coordination centre with a similar mandate as Prashant Kishor’s in Uttar Pradesh. The social media, data analytics, research, and communication departments will be answerable to Gupta. This rapid rise is because of his stellar work in managing the war rooms of the Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Rajasthan elections. Considered to be close to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Gupta’s rise signals the hegemonic presence of the Gujarat lobby in the Congress. In the recently-held CWC meeting on April 2, Rohan Gupta was the only non-CWC member who took part.
 
After MP, Rajasthan next?
The coronavirus scare seems to be having little or no impact on the disquiet in the Rajasthan Congress, where chief minister Ashok Gehlot is at loggerheads with his deputy, Sachin Pilot. When prime minister Narendra Modi video-conferenced with CMs, many appeared with their deputies and senior ministers but Pilot was kept out. While Gehlot is trying to take full credit for his handling of the coronavirus crisis in Bhilwara and other places, Pilot is never short of pointing out the shortcomings. The buzz in Jaipur is that a Madhya Pradesh-like political drama is contemplated and a regional party may be floated.
 
BSP leverage in Gwalior-Chambal
There is a sense of anticipation among Bahujan Samaj Party leaders in Madhya Pradesh where byelections to 23 Assembly seats will be held within a few months. The BSP is not a major force in the state but in the Gwalior-Chambal region, where most of the byelections are slated to be held, it has pockets of influence. BSP leaders think both the ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress will go out of their way to accommodate or win the BSP over. It is time for hard bargaining. Is BSP supremo Mayawati keeping tabs?
 
Filmmaker’s overtures
Political circles are intrigued by Pankaj Shankar, an independent filmmaker who is closely identified with the Congress. Of late, however, Shankar has been attacking and abusing Rahul Gandhi with a vengeance on social media platforms. He released a web series mocking and ridiculing the former AICC chief. His fictional account titled Love You Pappu, however, does not even have a fig-leaf to cover his political slant. The teaser giving a glimpse of the work culture in the Congress shows Mahatma Gandhi visiting Pappu’s office and not getting an appointment.
 
Perhaps Shankar is headed for greener pastures. But following the induction of Tom Vadakkan, an AICC media department functionary, the BJP does not seem interested in taking in lowly functionaries whose claim to fame has been “famous for being famous”. Two media-savvy brothers from Pune have also been unsuccessful in selling their loyalty though they adopted different methods.

"I was speaking yesterday to a friend from Bangalore who has lived in the United States for most of his life. He is employed by a software firm and his work requires him to travel to India three times a year. I have known him for about a quarter century and he has been coming with regularity. It has been his routine and he spends at least 60 days each year in India on work.
However, he will not be coming to Bangalore next month, as he was supposed to do, and he does not know when he would next be sent. Companies and businesses will not put their employees at risk any time soon, especially those firms based in America and Europe. They have laws which individuals can use if they feel they have been endangered and their safety jeopardised by their employer. Till there is a vaccine for Covid-19, this situation will remain uncertain.
 
Of course, this will have an impact on the airlines. Already there is a ban on international travel pretty much across the world. Europeans cannot go to America and vice versa. No passenger flights are operating in India. Even when the lockdown is opened in mid April, the number of people flying on work internally will be low and after an initial couple of days when those who are stuck go immediately to where they need to be, the traffic will be lower each month than it was last year.
How will airlines, which operate on very thin margins and sometimes operate at a loss as we have seen in India, manage? They will not be able to and the state will need to decide whether to bail them out (meaning tax payer money to be used on airplane leases and pilot and crew salaries) or let them die. From a position where India was about to sell its national carrier, Air India, we are faced with the possibility that the government buys stakes in a few more and possibly all airlines.
 
Tourism employs something like 10 per cent of the world’s population. My friend stays in a hotel in Bangalore and that place will also lose income from business travellers for the foreseeable future. Restaurants will be hit for the new few months as people will continue remaining home unless absolutely required to be in public spaces. Similarly, malls and cinema halls and all those sorts of places which have high levels of mingling and crowds will suffer crushing losses of revenue. How will we cope and what will our new economy look like? We do not know at this point and we will need to learn as we go along.
 
The chief economist of HDFC bank has written this week that the cost of Covid 19 to the Indian economy will be $100 billion, or Rs 7.5 lakh crore. That is equal to what India spends on defence plus all central government schemes (MNREGA, education, health, PM Awas, Smart Cities, Swachch Bharat, Mid Day meals, drinking water, irrigation etc) combined. Meaning that either we do not spend on all these things, which is not possible, or we borrow or print the money required to do all this.
It is hard to imagine a sector which will not be violently affected by the health crisis, the lockdown and what will come after. The sales for cars and automobiles in March were 50 per cent lower in India than they were in March 2019. This is despite the fact that we lost only about eight days due to the lockdown that month. In April the hit will be bigger because half the month is part of the lockdown. Power consumption was 25 per cent lower this week than in April 2019. This is entirely because factories are shut down and will lose three weeks of output at least. After that, they will hope that their workers return from villages and that is not going to happen soon.
 
There are three or four estimates on what the cost to the Gross Domestic Product of India will be. The most positive one says that we will lose two per cent points of GDP growth. The most negative says we will lose four per cent. The truth is that nobody knows at the moment what will come in April and May, just as nobody anticipated in February that March would turn out the way that it did though the Coronavirus story was already in the headlines then.
It will occupy the world for the rest of 2020 and perhaps even beyond that and will have medium and long-term ramifications. The short term ones, the ones that we have described above, are immediate and visible. But there will be others, especially on the future of the global economy, that may impact us for an entire generation. Because we are currently in the middle of the immediate health crisis, there has not been much discussion of this so far but it will start soon.
 
It is a very difficult task ahead for the prime minister and for the nation, even after the lockdown ends.

"Chennai: As cities world over go through various phases of lockdown, people living in strange places away from friends and family would long for some familiarity. With Tinder’s Passport feature, a Chennaiite stuck in Lucknow, can now choose potential dates from their own hometown—even if it’s only for an online date, given the circumstances.
The Passport feature, formerly open only to Tinder Plus and Gold users, was made open to all on March 26. It allows you to drop a pin in a location of your choice and look for matches in that city.
 
""We hope our members, many of whom are anxious and looking for more human connection, can use Passport to transport themselves out of self-quarantine or isolation to anywhere in the world,"" Tinder CEO Elie Seidman said in a statement.
 “Now more than ever, having someone to talk to makes a world of a difference,” says the tagline for Passport on the Go Tinder blog. Since Passport became free, Tinder has registered the highest number of swipes on March 29. Indians used Passport 25 per cent more after it became a free feature.
 
Tinder passport is open to all users of the app till April 30.

"India is in lockdown until April 15 and the city of Punjab saw the most drastic effect of air pollution reduction.
The picturesque snow-clad mountain range was visible for the first time in Jalandhar on Friday, over a week since the lockdown was imposed on the midnight of March 24.
 
The Dhauladhar mountain range, part of the Himalayan range in Himachal Pradesh, became visible in Jalandhar after years as pollution dipped across Punjab.
As more and more residents laid eyes on the entire Himalayan range from their rooftops, social media was filled with some delightful images.
Ace Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh took to his twitter to express his joy about the same.
Indeed it was a sight to behold for all the punjab residents and its something to cherish forever.

"With the cult classic film Hera Pheri completing 20 years after its release in March 2000, the buzz about a series revival is stronger than ever before. Starring Paresh Rawal as Baburao with Akshay Kumar and Suniel Shetty as Raju and Shyam, the film got two action heroes into comic roles, doing everything unheroic on screen and yet managing to entertain the audience.
“I cannot fathom the kind of response I still get about the film,” reminisces Suniel Shetty, who confirms that a remake is in the works. “The film is happening for sure. I won’t know when,” he had told us recently.
 
“The first part had both of us, action heroes, doing comedy for the first time. We were shooting for the film in Chennai and we wrapped the film in a single location in a lockdown kind of situation —that is how director Priyadarshan works,” the actor further reveals.
If one recalls, the second part never came close to being as funny as the original as most of the actors in the film tried to get loud and get the plaudits that only Baburao got in the film.
Producer Firoz Nadiadwala — who last made Welcome Back — was last speaking to both Priyadarshan as well as Ahmed Khan to see who could direct the third part. Priyadarshan had directed the first part while Neeraj Vora directed the second part. Neeraj was to direct the third part of the film, but he expired. Earlier in 2015, they had planned the film with a partial change in cast with Dostana duo John Abraham and Abhishek Bachchan stepping in along with Suniel playing Ghanshyam, and Paresh retaining his Baburao slot. However, that did not happen.

"Saloni’s twitter account has 98.3k followers and this charming college student’s impersonation of Kangana Ranaut who she wickedly calls Kangana ‘'Runnout’, has earned her 34.7k likes on Twitter. “I hope she likes it too. I have seen Queen multiple times and I believe Kangana is a great actress,” she quickly adds.
It is Kangana, who by default paved the way for Saloni’s foray into comic videos. “I used to mimic her in school and my friends loved it,” she concedes. This youngster straddles dual worlds. She studies economics and political science by day at her university and recedes into her hostel, to make comic videos. “Initially I only did voiceovers but one day a random video I made went viral and my friends suggested that I should show my face. So I bought this wig from Amazon as a part of my get up and everybody loved it. Everyone was making videos. When I joined insta I noticed that Mallika Dua was making videos. I did not know how to channel my thoughts into a video. My brother Shubham, who has appeared in Amazon Prime’s Hostel Days and he’s a Youtuber, guided me.”
 
And that is how the demure housewife with fierce views became an instant hit. And the biggest high for her was, “When Kusha Kapila messaged me after seeing my video. I was on cloud nine that day,” she says.
Nazma Aapi airs her views nonchalantly on everything from panic buying post corona virus to a desi mother-in-law’s views post lockdown. Like actress Sonam, who Saloni recently impersonated and even got an appreciated response back, the young sensation has the ability to laugh at herself. Recounting an older video on Delhi’s air pollution, she laughingly admits, “I look very poor in that video. I stay at a hostel in Delhi. I opened the door, it was so hazy, I just woke up, did not wash my face, used my phone camera and started shooting. I look so pathetic.”
 
You’ve got to hand it to Saloni. She exudes remarkable self confidence when she says, “People ask me why I don’t apply make up? So when I mimicked Sonam I put on the best kurta I had, to do justice to Sonam as she is a fashion icon. But Nazmi aapi does not require a makeover,” asserts the girl who also doubles up as the background guy who comments in her videos. I am the guy in the background, I can imitate Jimmy Shergil too, so decided to do the male voice over.”
Saloni who hails from UP modestly states she is not famous in her hometown but wickedly adds that her relatives are wary of her as she might just mimic them. “My nani refuses to speak in front of me as she is afraid that I will imitate her also,” she laughs.
 
Saloni happily admits that none of her videos have generated any hate mails or comments. “I am very balanced and take care not to offend anyone in my social commentary.”
The future looks bright as Saloni is currently doing collaborative videos and ads and will be venturing into radio soon. Speaking about the process of creating, Saloni says that working on filmi impersonations does not take time but when she dons the garb of Nazma Aapi, it takes her 2.5 hours to work on the script and shoot. “My parents are supportive. They told me to not target anybody and that is something that I am cautious about. My brother too was very supportive.”

"Billionaire technology entrepreneur Elon Musk had recently taken to the microblogging site to tweet, “Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.”
Even though the Government of India, recently, prohibited the export of surgical masks and ventilators because of its shortage in hospitals, the uber-rich are panic-buying and hoarding ventilators at home at the cost of Rs 10 lakh. Ventilators are used for patients suffering from coronavirus to keep them alive if they struggle to breathe.
 
But is this a sensible move? Experts including Dr Sundeep Lakhtakia, who is a senior consultant at Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, feel otherwise. “This is sheer stupidity and waste of resources. It’s like buying a fighter jet for whenever we may have a war even when one does not know how to fire a missile, let alone fly a plane,” he says.
To begin with, those buying/hoarding a ventilator tend to forget that they will still need someone to manage the machine at home. Moreover, where will they find the necessary therapist or doctor to run the ventilator if it comes to that? For those wondering if it is, in the first place, possible to run a critical care patient privately at home especially in the Indian scenario, Dr Khizar Raoof, Consultant Urologist, Olive Hospital, shares his thoughts. “Unless they have an intensivist — a specialist doctor handling ICUs  — at home, it’s of no use. We just don’t have enough staff to run hospitals, let alone home ventilators,” he cautions. Adding to the above thought, Dr Sunil Kapoor, senior Interventional Cardiologist, Apollo Hospitals, says, “It needs to be connected to a high-pressure oxygen line, which is available only in the ICCU of hospitals.”
 
Procedure and infrastructure
In addition to the above, ventilator settings also must be monitored and changed as per the patient’s need, depending on the patient’s condition. What’s more, the patient must be appropriately sedated to tolerate the ventilator. So essentially, the issue here is about how to set it up.
“Adjustment of a ventilator is an hourly issue,” explains Dr Chaitanya Challa, Challa Nursing Home. “A doctor has to be constantly present to adjust it. Buying an oxygen concentrator at home is acceptable, but a ventilator at home is not feasible. Ventilators also need an oxygen supply and compressed air, which is again not possible at home.”
 
According to Dr K. Subba Reddy, Sr Consultant Critical Care, Apollo Health City, ventilating a patient requires the entire intensive care infrastructure. “Just buying ventilators and keeping them ready outside ICU settings is not advisable. Sometimes, they may require prolonged ventilator support,” he adds. “Further, they require good doctors and nurses to take care of them. They may also require other organ support such as dialysis and multiple other consultants’ involvement. Added to it all, they will require very close monitoring to wean off the ventilator. So, it is not possible to create efficient ICUs at home.”
 
Other valid concerns
In government-run hospitals, it is very difficult to get vacant ventilators. In private hospitals, ventilators are available but are highly priced. So also, experts think it unwise and warn against anyone getting into an unnecessary panic-buying of ventilators during this time.
“In the Indian scenario, if things go worse, the government will take over all the ventilators. Even the ones in private hospitals,” warns Dr Khizar Raoof. “They’re already getting private medical colleges ready, and if the need arises, private hospitals will also become a part of the war against corona.”
 
Dr Sunil Kapoor also reminds people that very few of the corona patients need ventilators in the first place.
“COVID-19 infection results in respiratory distress syndrome in only 2-4 per cent of people. For instance, as of now, there are 40 patients admitted in the COVID-19 ward of the Gandhi Hospital and not a single patient is on ventilator,” elaborates Dr Sunil Kapoor.
